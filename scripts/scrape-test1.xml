      <abstract source="producer">This special topic poll, fielded November 12, 2000, is part
 of a continuing series of monthly surveys that solicit public opinion
 on the presidency and on a range of other political and social
 issues. This data collection focused on the presidential election that
 took place on November 7, 2000. Respondents were asked about the
 extent of their personal interest in and concern about the situation
 in the country five days after the election. Questions examined
 opinions on the way various groups were handling the election,
 including Vice President Al Gore's and Texas governor George W. Bush's
 campaigns, local officials in Florida, and the news media. Respondents
 were also asked whom they wanted to see become the next
 president. Opinions were elicited on the need for a new presidential
 election in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the entire state of
 Florida, in other states where election results were very close, and
 across the entire country. Additional topics covered whether George
 W. Bush and Al Gore should accept the recount in Florida or should ask
 courts to look into whether the voting was unfair and if they should ask
 for a recount in other states where the results were very close. Those
 polled expressed their views about electing the president by direct
 popular vote versus by the Electoral College, their confidence about
 the accuracy of Florida's recount, and whether the ballot that was
 used in Palm Beach County was fair. The survey also investigated what
 impact the unclear post-election situation would have, especially on
 the country's system of presidential elections. Background information
 on respondents includes age, gender, education, race, party
affiliation, political orientation, and voter registration.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">The data contain records of charges filed against defendants whose cases were terminated by United States attorneys in United States district court during fiscal year 2009. The data are charge-level records, and more than one charge may be filed against a single defendant. The data were constructed from the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) Central Charge file. The charge-level data may be linked to defendant-level data (extracted from the EOUSA Central System file) through the CS_SEQ variable, and it should be noted that some defendants may not have any charges other than the lead charge appearing on the defendant-level record. The Central Charge and Central System data contain variables from the original EOUSA files as well as additional analysis variables, or "SAF" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.</abstract>

 of all recorded deaths occurring in the United States, Puerto Rico,
 the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the
 Northern Marianas during 2000, 2001, and 2002. Data are provided
 concerning underlying causes of death, multiple conditions that caused
 the death, place of death, residence of the deceased (e.g., region,
 division, state, county), whether an autopsy was performed, and the
 month and day of the week of the death. In addition, data are supplied
 on the sex, race, age, marital status, education, usual occupation,
 and origin or descent of the deceased. Mortality detail data can be
 extracted from this file. The mortality detail records are contained
 in the first 159 positions of these multiple cause records. In
 addition to the combined Territory Public-Use file for each year, a
 subset based on state of occurrence has been created for Puerto Rico,
 Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and Northern Marianas. The
 multiple cause of death fields were coded from the MANUAL OF THE

      <abstract>This Gallup poll seeks the opinions of Canadians, on both political and social issues. The questions ask opinions about the Federal government and other political issues within the country. There are also questions on other topics of interest and importance to the country such as opinions about receiving and paying traffic tickets, places to eat out at and living together before marriage. The respondents were also asked questions so that they could be grouped according to geographical variables. Topics of interest include: the frequency of eating out; going to court because of a traffic ticket; the influence of television; licensed drivers taking physicals; living together before marriage; the opinions of the Federal government since last election; pampering children; paying traffic tickets; the rising price of income and taxes; places to eat out at; receiving traffic tickets; running the government; sale of nuclear reactors; and taking work instead of welfare. Basic demographic variables are also included.</abstract>

      <abstract>We assessed the responses of photosynthetic traits of native and invasive C3 and C4 grasses to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. We used three levels of CO2 (390, 700, and 1000 ppm) in a closed chamber experiment and tested 16 grass species (eight C3 plants and eight C4) classified as noninvasive or invasive. We tested the hypotheses that invasive species would be more productive under elevated CO2 and that the strongest responses would be seen in C3 plants.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This round of Eurobarometer surveys diverged from the Standard Eurobarometer measures and queried respondents on the following major areas of focus: (1) poverty and social exclusion, (2) mobile phone use, (3) economic crisis, and (4) international trade. For the first major area of focus, poverty and social exclusion, the survey queried respondents about their own definition of poverty, the extent of poverty and homelessness in their area, and whether or not respondents believed poverty had increased in their area and elsewhere. Respondents were queried about what necessities people must be able to afford to meet a minimal acceptable living standard, who is most at risk for poverty, as well as the social, political, and personal causes of poverty and homelessness. Respondents were also asked about how poverty impacts peoples’ chances of completing certain activities, such as getting a good education or finding a job. Respondents were then asked whether or not they trust the European Union (EU), their governments, charities, other citizens, and miscellaneous institutions to effectively respond to poverty. Respondents were also asked to whom they assign primary responsibility for reducing or preventing poverty, what policies their governments should focus on in the future in the effort to help people out of poverty, and whether or not respondents approved of their government’s existing anti-poverty measures. Respondents were also queried about their perception of social tensions between groups, and about what they have done personally to help poor people. Additionally, respondents were queried about their own living conditions, satisfaction with life, ability to keep a job, efforts to fight poverty, finances, and their own risk of falling into poverty. For the second major area of focus, mobile phone use, the survey asked respondents about whether or not they owned a mobile phone, their mobile phone use in other EU countries, and the cost of cellular phone service in those countries. For the third major area of focus, economic crisis, the survey questioned respondents about the degree to which the crisis personally affected them, how the crisis affected the EU and its policy efforts, who should bear responsibility for the crisis, who should bear the burden of response to the crisis, and how the European Parliament and other bodies should respond to the crisis. For the fourth major area of focus, international trade, the survey queried respondents on whether they pay attention to the country of origin for products they purchase, how trade impacts respondents and their countries, what European Union trade policy should be going into the future, and the European Union’s international economic standing. Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, nationality, marital status and parental relations, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other durable goods, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, and Internet use. In addition, country-specific data includes type and size of locality, region of residence, and language of interview (select countries).</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">The Michigan Student Study was designed to examine the
 factors that influence students' intellectual responses to issues of
 racial and ethnic diversity. The focus was not only on the attitudes
 and experiences of students of color (Asian American, Latino/Hispanic,
 African American and Native American students) but on the contribution
 of diversity to the broader intellectual experiences of White students
 as well. The longitudinal design of the Michigan Study allowed for
 consideration of what students bring to the university at entrance, as
 well as documenting important changes as they move toward graduation.
 One set of questions addressed the general undergraduate experience of
 students at the University of Michigan, the positive and negative
 aspects of their experiences with faculty, interactions with fellow
 students, extracurricular involvements, reactions to their academic
 and intellectual experiences, and how similar or different the
 experiences of students of different racial/ethnic backgrounds were.
 Another set of questions dealt with the racial "climate" on campus,
 the degree of racial tension, the students' perceptions of and
 responses to the University's commitment to multiculturalism and
 diversity, the perceptions and views that students brought to the
 campus and how much they were affected and changed by their
 experiences at the University of Michigan, the positive aspects and
 specific arenas of concern for the various groups of students around
 multiculturalism, and the relevancy of the University's commitment to
multiculturalism and diversity.</abstract>

Additional questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and opinions on the European Union (EU) including how well-informed they felt about it, what sources of information about the EU they used, whether their country had benefited from being an EU member (or would benefit from being a future member), and the extent
of their personal interest in EU matters. Another major focus of the surveys was to ask respondents to express their opinion in regard to the European Constitution, including its adoption and ratification. Respondents also were asked about EU enlargement including whom they would favor to join the EU, the political, social, and economic effects of enlargement, and initiatives for the success of further EU enlargement. In addition, respondents were asked questions about exports versus imports and migration among the EU's old and new member states, the accession of Western Balkan countries and Turkey, and  financial assistance available to EU member and candidate countries. Special topics included quality of life, avian influenza, and energy issues. For the first special topic, quality of life, the survey asked respondents to evaluate the economic, social, and environmental situation among several domains, in addition to their personal financial status and quality of life, and to identify priorities for the improvement of the EU economy. For the next special topic, respondents were queried about avian influenza, its transmission,  regulations preventing its spread, their behavior in consuming poultry and eggs, dissemination of health information, and public safety. For the final special topic, respondents answered questions about their usage of energy and how the EU citizens and government could reduce energy consumption and utilize alternative resources. Demographic and other background information includes age, gender, nationality, birthplace, marital status, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age at completion of full-time education, household composition, religious affiliation and involvement, and ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other durable goods. In addition, country-specific data include size of locality, region of residence, language of interview (select countries), and a list of television channels, radio stations, and daily newspapers that respondents regularly viewed, listened to, or read during the course of a week.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This round of Euro-Barometer surveys queried respondents on
standard Euro-Barometer measures, such as how satisfied they were with
their present life, whether they attempted to persuade others close to
them to share their views on subjects they held strong opinions about,
whether they discussed political matters, what their country's goals
should be for the next ten years, and how they viewed the need for
societal change. Additional questions focused on the respondents'
knowledge of and opinions on the European Community (EC), including
how well-informed they felt about the EC, what sources of information
about the EC they used, whether their country had benefited from being
an EC member, and the extent of their personal interest in EC
matters. Another major focus of the surveys was on the causes and
consequences of unemployment, both generally and among women and youth
in particular. Those who had been unemployed during the previous three
years were asked about their ability to obtain various kinds of public
assistance and how selective they were when looking for work.
Attitudes toward the European Parliamentary elections (postponed from
1978 to 1979) also continued to be measured. Demographic information
gathered includes respondents' religion, education, occupation,
marital status, age, and sex, as well as the occupation of the head of
household and the composition of the household. In addition to the
survey itself, the ICPSR version of the study contains constructed
indices on materialist/post-materialist values, left-right partisan
vote, European Parliament partisan vote, and cognitive mobilization
(an indicator of an individual's potential to take an active role in
the political process). Euro-Barometer 9 contains data gathered from
representative samples of respondents aged 15 or older interviewed in
each of the nine nations of the EC (Germany, Great Britain, Denmark,
Italy, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Netherlands) in April
1978.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This poll is part of a continuing series of monthly surveys
 that solicit public opinion on the presidency and on a range of other
 political and social issues. Respondents were asked whether they approved
 of Bill Clinton's handling of his job as president and whether he was
 a strong and decisive leader. They were also asked to rate
 Clinton's handling of the nation's economy, foreign affairs, the federal
 budget deficit, and the federal response to the flooding in the
 Midwest. Those queried were also asked in detail about Clinton's
 economic plan -- specifically, whether they supported
 the increase in federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel, the
 new federal tax rate on upper-income families, raising the tax on
 Social Security benefits, the increase in the federal business tax rate, and
 spending cuts in Medicare. Other topics included abortion, the
 situation in Serbia and Bosnia, and whether the respondent approved of
 United States airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Roman Catholic Church was
 also a focus of this monthly survey, with specific
 questions on church policies and moral rules. Demographic background variables
include political orientation, sex, age, race, income, and education.</abstract>

Ce fichier de microdonnées à grande diffusion renferme des données non agrégées associées à une vaste gamme de variables recueillies dans le cadre de l'Enquête sur la population active (EPA). L'EPA recueille des renseignements mensuels sur l'activité de la population canadienne en âge de travailler. Ce produit est destiné aux utilisateurs qui préfèrent réaliser leur propre analyse et qui s'intéressent à des sous-groupes particuliers de la population ou qui désirent effectuer des recoupements de variables ne faisant pas partie de nos produits catalogués.

Le fichier renferme les caractéristiques personnelles de tous les membres du ménage et les caractéristiques détaillées de l'activité de tous les membres du ménage âgés de 15 ans et plus. Parmi les caractéristiques personnelles figurent l'âge, le sexe, l'état matrimonial, le niveau d'instruction et les caractéristiques de la famille. Les caractéristiques détaillées de l'activité comprennent des renseignements sur l'emploi, comme la catégorie de travailleurs, les heures habituellement et effectivement travaillées, le salaire horaire et hebdomadaire de l'employé, la branche d'activité associée à l'emploi actuel ou au dernier emploi, le secteur public ou privé, la couverture syndicale, les heures supplémentaires rémunérées et non rémunérées, la permanence de l'emploi, les heures de travail perdues, la durée de l'emploi, de même que les renseignements sur le chômage, comme la durée du chômage, les méthodes de recherche d'emploi et le genre de travail recherché. Les données sur les caractéristiques de l'activité des étudiants pendant l'année scolaire et pendant la période estivale, sur la fréquentation scolaire à temps plein ou à temps partiel ainsi que sur le type d'établissement sont également disponibles. Ces données et d'autres renseignements sont disponibles selon la province et pour les trois principales régions métropolitaines de recensement (Montréal, Toronto et Vancouver).

Il s'agit d'un fichier mensuel, et les données disponibles remontent à 1976.

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;Depuis le début de 2005, l'Enquête sur les voyages des résidents du Canada (EVRC) a été menée afin de mesurer les voyages intérieurs au Canada. Elle remplace l'Enquête sur les voyages des Canadiens (EVC). Grâce aux changements apportés aux définitions et au questionnaire, les estimations de voyages intérieurs se rapprocheront des directives internationales recommandées par l'Organisation mondiale du tourisme (OMT) et la Commission statistique des Nations Unies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L'Enquête sur les voyages des résidents du Canada est parrainée par Statistique Canada, la Commission canadienne du tourisme (CCT), les gouvernements provinciaux et certains organismes fédéraux. Elle mesure l'ampleur des voyages intérieurs au Canada, du point de vue de la demande. L'enquête vise à recueillir de l'information sur le volume de voyages et des dépenses des résidents du Canada selon l'origine du voyage, la destination, la durée, le type d'hébergement utilisé, le but du voyage, le moyen de transport, etc., à recueillir de l'information sur l'incidence des voyages et fournir le profil sociodémographique des voyageurs et des non-voyageurs. Les estimations permettent d'effectuer des analyses sur une base trimestrielle à l'échelle nationale, provinciale et régionale (à divers degrés de précision) concernant les informations suivantes :
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt; nombre total de voyages d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus effectués par les résidents du Canada et dont la destination était au Canada;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; visites d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus au Canada;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; raison principale du voyage et activités principales effectuées pendant le voyage;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; dépenses effectuées pour les voyages d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus au Canada par les résidents du Canada, au total et selon la catégorie de dépenses;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; moyens de transport utilisés pendant le voyage (principal/autre);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; visites-personnes, visites-ménages, dépenses totales et par catégorie de dépenses pour chaque endroit visité au Canada;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; nuitées-personnes et nuitées-ménages passées à chaque endroit visité au Canada, au total et selon le type d'hébergement utilisé;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; utilisation de forfaits de voyage et dépenses qui y sont associées et participation à des excursions guidées en autocar/autre;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; personne ou organisme ayant payé les coûts du voyage (ménage, gouvernement, employeur privé);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; caractéristiques démographiques des adultes qui ont effectué des voyages et ceux qui n'en n'ont pas effectués;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; composition du groupe des voyageurs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les utilisateurs principaux des données de l'EVRC sont Statistique Canada, la Commission canadienne du tourisme, les provinces et les bureaux de tourisme. Les médias, les entreprises, les consultants, ainsi que les chercheurs, comptent parmi les autres utilisateurs.&lt;/p&gt;

Management's first major survey of the work force since 1983. The
questionnaire was designed to provide policy-makers with information
that was not available from existing sources. Questions covered various
personnel areas such as employee characteristics, employees'
satisfaction with their jobs, supervisors, and organizations,
performance management, training, work schedule arrangements, leave
benefits, and dependent care responsibilities and the ways in which employees
fulfill these responsibilities.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This study is part of a time-series collection of national
surveys fielded continuously since 1952. The election studies are
designed to present data on Americans' social backgrounds, enduring
political predispositions, social and political values, perceptions and
evaluations of groups and candidates, opinions on questions of public
policy, and participation in political life. The 1989 Pilot Study, like
its predecessors, provides an opportunity to refine existing National
Election Study measures and to develop and test new instrumentation.
These data include new measures of religious identity and the political
salience of religion, media exposure and the type of information
recalled, and individualism represented by predispositions to autonomy,
self-reliance, laissez-faire, and limited government. A significant
portion of the study is devoted to experiments contrasting different
instrumentation for issue questions. New items on gun control,
abortion, and the Alaska oil spill also are included.</abstract>

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;Le fichier de conversion des codes postaux (FCCP) est un fichier numérique qui permet d'établir un lien entre les codes postaux à six caractères et les unités géographiques normalisées de Statistique Canada pour lesquelles les données du recensement et d'autres statistiques sont produites. Les liens entre les codes postaux et les unités géographiques normalisées font du FCCP un outil permettant d'intégrer des données de diverses sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voici un guide pour&lt;a href="http://odesi2.scholarsportal.info/documentation/PCCF/census_years/1996/nov2000/Getting_Started_fra_nov2000.html" target="blank"&gt; comment commencer. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour obtenir le fichier de conversion des codes postaux ou pour des questions, consultez &lt;a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/fra/idd/contact" target="_blank"&gt;la personne-ressource IDD&lt;/a&gt; de votre établissement d'enseignement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les coordonnées géographiques attribuées à chaque code postal dans le FCCP sont généralement utilisées pour cartographier la distribution des données aux fins d'analyse spatiale (par ex., les clients, les activités). Les renseignements sur la localisation s'avèrent un outil puissant pour fins de marketing, de planification ou de recherche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C'est en avril 1983 que la Division de la géographie a diffusé une première version du FCCP qui établissait un lien entre les codes postaux et les unités géographiques du recensement et comprenait des coordonnées géographiques. Depuis, ce fichier est régulièrement mis à jour afin de tenir compte des changements apportés par la Société canadienne des postes.
Chaque cinq ans, les appariements de codes postaux dans le FCCP sont adaptés afin de correspondre aux unités géographiques du recensement le plus récent. Le premier FCCP établissait un lien aux unités géographiques du recensement de 1981. Depuis, le FCCP a connu trois "conversions", à la suite des recensements de 1986, de 1991 et de1996. Un système informatisé a été développé pour la conversion de 1991-1996. De plus, les codes postaux déclarés au recensement de 1996 ont été utilisés pour la première fois afin de valider les appariements du FCCP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>
There exists a growing need for information on recent immigrants to Canada. As part of adapting to life in Canada, many immigrants face challenges such as finding suitable accommodation, learning or becoming more fluent in one or both of Canada's official languages, participating in the labour market or accessing education and training opportunities. The results of this survey will provide indicators of how immigrants are meeting these and other challenges. While integration may take many years, the LSIC is designed to examine the first four years of settlement, a time when newcomers establish economic, social and cultural ties to Canadian society. To this end, the objectives of the survey are two-fold: to study how new immigrants adjust to life in Canada over time; and, to provide information on the factors that can facilitate or hinder this adjustment.

Topics covered in the survey include language proficiency, housing, education, foreign credential recognition, employment, health, values and attitudes, the development and use of social networks, income, and perceptions of settlement in Canada. 

Since immigration is a shared jurisdiction between national and provincial departments the information gathered through the LSIC will be beneficial to many groups including both federal and provincial government departments, immigrant settlement agencies, non-governmental organizations and researchers. Survey results will also play an important role in planning and developing programs that will assist future immigrants settling in Canada.

Note that a public use microdata file will not be created for this survey. Data from the survey may be accessed through Statistics Canada's Research Data Centres (RDC). For more information visit Statistics Canada's Research Data Centres site at http://www.statcan.ca/english/rdc/index.htm.

 respondents were asked: if they voted in the last election, who they 
 voted for, if they were planning to vote in the upcoming election for 
 the House of Representatives, and who they were likely to vote for in 
 that election. They were asked to rate Reagan's performance as 
 president on issues such as the economy, foreign affairs, and aid to 
 the poor. They were also questioned about which political party they 
 generally support and what they believe to be the nation's worst 
 problem. Respondents to the follow-up questionnaire were again asked 
 who they would be voting for as well as whether they perceived the 
 state of the economy as getting better or worse. Demographic 
characteristics were also recorded.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">The purpose of the study was to collect survey data on the
 employment/work histories, family structure histories, and residential
 mobility histories of Russian adults from January 1985 through the end
 of the survey. The work histories include the following information
 about each job held during that time period: occupation, how the job
 was found, employer type, industry, and size. In addition,
 the survey gathered information on current residence, occupation,
 other job characteristics, earnings, sources of household income,
 household ownership of consumer goods, basic demographic indicators,
 and attitude measures. The data were designed to be used
 for multivariate analysis of the factors influencing changes in
 employment status, job mobility of various types, changes in marital
 status, fertility, and residential mobility in Russia during the
 period of 1985-2001. Since the period covered by the histories spans
 the final seven years of the Soviet era and the first decade of the
 post-Soviet era, the data are uniquely suited for assessing whether
 the transition from Soviet-style socialism has affected
 stratification, family formation, and migration processes. Moreover,
 because the data include work/employment, family structure, and
 migration histories, the dataset is uniquely suited for dynamic
 analyses of the inter-relationships among states and events in these
 three domains. Finally, because the data contain information on each
 respondent's oblast (region) of residence at all points in time from
 1985-2001, data on regional characteristics can be merged with files
 created from the survey data, in order to measure the impact of
 regional characteristics on individual-level events. The data can be
 used to investigate job and employment transitions, union formation
 and dissolution, fertility, departures of children, internal
 migration, determinants of earnings, wage arrears, consumption, and
other topics.</abstract>

      <abstract>This data collection provides information on characteristics
of housing units in 11 selected Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)
of the United States. Although the unit of analysis is the housing unit
rather than its occupants, the survey also is a comprehensive source of
information on the demographic characteristics of household residents.
Data collected include general housing characteristics such as the year
the structure was built, type and number of living quarters, occupancy
status, presence of commercial establishments on the property, and
property value. Data are also provided on kitchen and plumbing
facilities, type of heating fuel used, source of water, sewage
disposal, and heating and air-conditioning equipment. Questions about
housing quality include condition of walls and floors, adequacy of heat
in winter, availability of electrical outlets in rooms, basement and
roof water leakage, and exterminator service for mice and rats. Data
related to housing expenses include mortgage or rent payments, utility
costs, fuel costs, property insurance costs, real estate taxes, and
garbage collection fees. Variables are also supplied on neighborhood
conditions such as quality of roads and presence of crime, trash,
litter, street noise, abandoned structures, commercial activity, and
odors or smoke, as well as the adequacy of services such as public
transportation, schools, shopping facilities, police protection,
recreation facilities, and hospitals or clinics. In addition to housing
characteristics, data on age, sex, race, marital status, income, and
relationship to householder are provided for each household member.
Additional data are supplied for the householder, including years of
school completed, Spanish origin, and length of residence.</abstract>

      <abstract>The primary purpose of the Identity Theft Supplement is to obtain additional information about identity theft-related victimizations so that policymakers, academic researchers, practitioners at the Federal, state and local levels, and special interest groups who are concerned with identity theft can make informed decisions concerning policies and programs. Responses are linked to the NCVS survey instrument responses for a more complete understanding of the individual's circumstances.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This survey was designed to measure public opinion of the Spanish population on a variety of topics relating to questions of national and supranational identity. Respondents were asked about their current situation, their concerns, degree of personal satisfaction, degree of happiness, and basic attitudes. Respondents were asked for their opinions about Spain and the world, and what they thought were the most important national and international issues. Respondents were asked about their identification with other countries and regions in around the world, as well as their knowledge of and interest in world affairs. A series of questions was also asked about their attitudes and identification with Latin America. Questions addressed the following specific topics: their knowledge of Latin American countries, their evaluation of Spanish influence in Latin America, present relations between Spain and Latin America, desired relations between Spain and Latin America, and their basic attitudes towards Spanish-Latin American relations. There was a similar series of questions relating to attitudes and identification with Europe. Respondents were asked about their knowledge of and attitudes toward the European Economic Community (EEC), the perceived benefits for Spain due to membership in the EEC, their degree of identification with Europe, their participation in European elections, the consequences of European unification, and their experience traveling in Europe. Respondents also were asked about their identification with their autonomous community and whether they identified more with it or with Spain. Demographic information includes gender, age, marital status, size of household, occupation, religion, political ideology, social class (subjective), place of birth, place of residence, education, and income.</abstract>

      <abstract>This Gallup poll seeks the opinions of Canadians, on predominantly social, and political issues. The questions ask opinions on the Meech Lake Accord, whether or not certain professions are overpaid or underpaid, who would best deal with Canada - Quebec problems, political leadership, decriminalization of marijiana, and locating Canadian cities on a map. There are also questions on other topics of interest such as the Federal Finance Minister, incidences of objectionable sexual content on TV, in movies, and in magazines, eutheanasia, and questions related to political party preference. The respondents were also asked questions so that they could be grouped according to geographic, political and social variables.

The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is conducted annually to obtain work experience and income information from Canadian households. The Survey provides up-to-date information on the distribution and sources of income, before and after taxes, for families and individuals. With this file, users may identify specific family types, such as two-parent and lone-parent families. Information is also provided on earnings, transfers, and total income for the head and the spouse of the census family unit, as well as personal and labour-related characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;This reference year for this file is 1993.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commencing with the 1998 microdata files, annual cross-sectional income data will be sourced from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID).&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The "Sysmiss" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the "Valid" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LFS revisions: 
LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. &lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract source="producer">The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
(PHDCN) was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families,
schools, and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent development.
One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which
was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over
6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and
their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing
circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,
that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to
gauge various aspects of human development, including individual
differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. The
Employment and Income Interview was an atypical measure in that its
primary concern was not to evaluate the developmental circumstances
but rather to assess the economic circumstances surrounding the
subjects. The Employment and Income Interview was administered to the
subjects' primary caregivers for Cohorts 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 and to
the subjects themselves for Cohort 18. The Employment and Income
Interview was developed specifically for the PHDCN Longitudinal Cohort
Study with the intent of combining the employment and income data
obtained with educational status data to create socioeconomic
stratifications for the respondents. The Employment and Income
Interview sought to obtain data describing the respondent's current or
most recent employment and that of his or her partner. The Employment
and Income Interview also sought information regarding primary income
and additional sources of income as well total working hours,
proximity to work, and means of transportation to work for both the
respondent and his or her partner.</abstract>

 <p source="producer">The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN)
 was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families, schools,
 and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent development. It was
 designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of
 both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the
 project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,
 adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the
 project provided a detailed look at the environments in which these
 social behaviors took place by collecting substantial amounts of data
 about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and
 resources.</p>

 <p source="producer">The city of Chicago was selected as the research site for the PHDCN
 because of its extensive racial, ethnic, and social-class diversity.
 The project collapsed 847 census tracts in the city of Chicago into
 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon seven groupings of
 racial/ethnic composition and three levels of socioeconomic status.
 The NCs were designed to be ecologically meaningful. They were
 composed of geographically contiguous census tracts and geographic
 boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered
 in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately
 8,000 people.</p>
 <p source="producer"><hi source="producer">Longitudinal Cohort Study</hi></p>
 <p source="producer">For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample
 of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21
 strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with
 the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to
 eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic
 status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected
 at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing
 of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.
 Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts
 (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through
 in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the
 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within
 six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were
 selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of
 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the
 eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.</p>
 <p source="producer">For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the
 child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to
 spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research
 assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child
 interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face
 interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the
 personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews
 were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete
 protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was
 hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,
 Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,
 participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other
 incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly
 drawing prizes were also included.</p>
 <p source="producer">Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For
 example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking
 traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,
 delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and
 self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also
 interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,
 parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental
 health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.</p>
 <p source="producer"><hi source="producer">Employment and Income Interview</hi></p>
 <p source="producer">The Employment and Income Interview was completed by primary
 caregivers (Cohorts 0 to 15) and subjects (Cohort 18). The interview
 contained questions regarding the employment status and income earned
 by the respondents in order to give an overview of the economic
 conditions under which the Longitudinal Cohort Study participants
 lived. Each respondent was asked to respond to questions concerning
 the details of his or her partner's employment and salary to give a
 complete summary of the household's economic situation. The response
 format for the Employment and Income Interview varied from question to
 question. Some questions were petitioned straightforward, yes or no
 responses. Other questions offered multiple choices of which the
 respondent was permitted to select the one response which best
 described their situation. Multiple responses were permitted for
 questions regarding the respondent's transportation to work.
 Additionally, there were questions that allowed for open-ended
responses.</p></abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">The variables from the Employment and Income
 questionnaire sought to gather information regarding the socioeconomic
 status of the family. Variables included in the Employment and Income
 data quantify information describing type of employment, proximity to
 job, and means of transportation. Other variables recorded salary
 information, number of working hours, and alternative sources of
 income. Also included were various administrative variables to specify
 such information as cohort, time and date that the measure was
 conducted, and identification variables for both the respondent and
the interviewer.</abstract>

      <abstract>This data collection contains basic demographic, social, and
economic data for each member of interviewed households in the first
six waves of the 1988 Panel of Survey of Income and Program
Participation (SIPP). Variables include age, sex, race, ethnic origin,
marital status, household relationship, education, and veteran status.
Limited data are provided on housing unit characteristics such as
number of units in structure and tenure. Core questions, repeated at
each interview, cover monthly labor force activity, types and amounts
of monthly income, and participation in various cash and noncash
benefits programs for each month of the survey period. Data for
employed persons include number of hours and weeks worked, earnings,
and weeks without a job. Nonworkers are classified as unemployed or not
in the labor force. In addition to income data associated with labor
force activity, nearly 50 other types of income data are provided.
Several variables are included for use in identifying longitudinal
households and persons in them and to aid in analysis.</abstract>

      <abstract>Using the 2007 National Apprenticeship Survey (NAS), this research paper estimates the earnings functions of individuals who completed or discontinued a registered apprenticeship program. Controlling for observed demographic, labour market, and employer characteristics correlated with the two apprenticeship states, it finds earnings differences of approximately 20%. The paper also disaggregates apprentices into four groups on the basis of program completion and certification in order to refine the wage comparisons.</abstract>

<p>Serial sexual assault is a pervasive problem: court record recidivism rates show that 10-15% of convicted sex offenders re-assault within five years and self-report studies suggest that 63-78% of males who have committed sexual assaults have raped more than one individual. The current study documents the scope of repeat sexual offending through a previously-unexplored method of documenting serial perpetration: DNA evidence in sexual assault kits (SAKs). Ultimately, the testing of N = 7,287 previously untested SAKs revealed n = 1,270 unique and identifiable perpetrators. When combined with information from lifetime criminal history records, 39.7% (n = 504) of this subsample of unique and identifiable perpetrators were found to be serial sexual offenders who committed, on average, 3.27 sexual assaults. </p>

      <abstract><p>The purpose of this study was to use DNA evidence as a data source for studying serial sexual assault perpetration. Analysis of the evidence in the standardized sexual assault kits (SAKs) could yield a DNA profile of the suspect, and that profile could be uploaded to the federal criminal DNA database CODIS (Combined DNA Index System) and searched against other DNA profiles to identify offenders. Matching DNA profiles across cases can link multiple crimes to the same perpetrator. As such, examining DNA linkages through SAK evidence offers another approach for studying repeat perpetration.</p></abstract>
      <abstract><p>In this project, the starting query was a sample of approximately 7,000 previously-untested sexual assault kits (SAKs) from Detroit, Michigan. First, the researchers examined how many offenders may have committed more than one sexual assault, based on DNA matches in CODIS (Combined DNA Index System) and other sexual assaults identified through a criminal history records check. Second, for those offenders who were suspected of committing multiple sexual assaults (based on CODIS and criminal history record data), the researchers used growth mixture models to explore their patterns of serial sexual offending over time.</p></abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">The data contain records of suspects in federal criminal matters received by United States attorneys or filed before the United States magistrates during fiscal year 2009. The data were constructed from the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) Central System file. Records include suspects in criminal matters, and are limited to suspects whose matters were not declined immediately by the United States attorneys. According to the EOUSA, the United States attorneys conduct approximately 95 percent of the prosecutions handled by the Department of Justice. The Central System data contain variables from the original EOUSA files as well as additional analysis variables, or "SAF" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Table 1.1. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.</abstract>

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt; L'Enquête sur la population active (EPA) fournit des estimations de l'emploi et du chômage, lesquelles figurent parmi les mesures les plus actuelles et les plus importantes de la performance de l'économie canadienne.  Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L'EPA, conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées (des employés), des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; L'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le secteur public ou privé, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage.  D’autres sujets incluent les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail.  Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Il s'agit d'un fichier mensuel, et les données disponibles remontent à 1976. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour une liste complète et une description des variables de l'EPA, veuillez consulter le Guide de l'Enquête sur la population active, disponible sous la section Questionnaire(s) et guide(s) de déclaration ci-dessus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note : &lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;
Puisque les valeurs manquantes sont retirées de cette série de données, toute forme de non-réponse (ex. enchaînement valide, non déclaré, ne sait pas, refus) ne peut être identifiée comme manquante. L'étiquette &lt;/em&gt;« Sysmiss »&lt;/em&gt; dans la section statistiques indique le nombre d'enregistrements de non-réponse pour chacune des variables, tandis que la valeur « Valid » indique le nombre d'enregistrements de réponses pour chacune des variables. Pour chacune des variables, le total d'enregistrements comprend les valeurs « Sysmiss » ainsi que &lt;/em&gt;« Valid »&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Révision de l'Enquête sur la population active (EPA): Les estimations de l'EPA étaient auparavant basées sur les estimations de la population du Recensement de 2006. Dorénavant, les données de l'EPA ont été rétroactivement ajustées jusqu'en 2001, pour refléter les estimations de la population du Recensement de 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Travel Survey of Residents of Canada (TSRC) is a major source of data used to measure the size and status of Canada's tourism industry. It was developed to mesure the volume, the characteristics and the economic impact of domestic travel. Since the beginning of 2005 this survey replaces the Canada Travel Survey (CTS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It measures the size of domestic travel in Canada from the demand side. The objectives of the survey are to provide information about the volume of trips and expenditures for Canadian residents by trip origin, destination, duration, type of accommodation used, trip reason, mode of travel, etc.; to provide information on travel incidence and to provide the socio-demographic profile of travellers and non-travellers. Estimates allow quarterly analysis at the national, provincial and tourism region level (with varying degrees of precision) on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total volume of same-day and overnight trips taken by the residents of Canada with destinations in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;same-day and overnight visits in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;main purpose of the trip/key activities on trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spending on same-day and overnight trips taken in Canada by Canadian residents in total and by category of expenditure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modes of transportation (main/other) used on the trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person-visits, household-visits, spending in total and by expense category for each location visited in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person- and party-nights spent in each location visited in Canada, in total and by type of accommodation used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of travel packages and associated spending and use of motor coach/other guided tours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source of payment (household, government, private employer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demographics of adults that took or did not take trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;travel party composition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three files for this survey - Trip File, Visit File, and Person File.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TSRC is an independant supplemnet to the Labour Force Survey (LFS).&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract source="producer">This special topic poll focused on issues of concern to
residents of Los Angeles. Respondents were queried regarding how things
were going in Los Angeles, the most important problem facing the city,
the future of the city, and whether they had seriously considered
moving out of Los Angeles in the last year. Major topics explored
include race relations, confidence in local police, the Los Angeles
criminal justice system and its treatment of Blacks, solving the
problems that led to the civil disturbances in the spring of 1992, the
Reginald Denny beating case, and the verdict in the Rodney King beating
case. Background information on respondents includes political party
identification, political orientation, 1992 mayoral vote choice,
education, age, race, Hispanic origin, family income, and sex.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This study was conducted in an effort to better understand 
 the circumstances surrounding murder cases in large urban areas. To 
 evaluate the 75 largest counties in the nation, 33 counties were 
 chosen. The ranking of these counties was based on a combination of 
 crime data and population data. The criteria for including a case on a 
 roster from which cases would be sampled was that (1) one or more 
 defendants must have been arrested for murder and (2) the case must 
 have been adjudicated during 1988. These cases were a sample of about 
 half of all those in the 33 counties studied that had a murder charge 
 brought to the prosecutors in 1988, or earlier, and that were disposed 
 during 1988. When statistically weighted, the sample cases represent a 
 total of 9,576 murder defendants in the nation's 75 largest counties. 
 Demographic information on victims and defendants includes sex, date of 
 birth, area of residence, and occupation. Variables are also provided 
 on the circumstances of the crime, including the relationship between the 
 victim and the defendant, the type of weapon used, the time of death, 
and the number of victims.</abstract>

    <search:metadata>
      <abstract><p>This data collection is comprised of responses from two sets of survey questionnaires, the basic Current Population Survey (CPS) and a survey administered as a supplement to the February 2002 questionnaire on the topic of tobacco use in the United States. The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also administered in June 2001 (ICPSR 4043) and November 2001 (ICPSR 4044). These three supplements comprise the 2001-2002 waves of TUS data.</p><p>The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.</p><p>All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS monthly items were eligible for the TUS, which consisted of items PES32 through PES77.  The TUS was mainly designed to be a proxy response survey, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent questions. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for questions on the topics of smoking status (items PES32-PES34) and the use of other tobacco products; for example, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PES62A-PES63B).</p><p>Additionally, self-respondents were asked various questions depending on their smoking status -- former, everyday, or occasional (items PES36-PES46 and PES55-PES61). Current everyday and occasional smokers were then asked whether the medical community had advised them to quit smoking or if they were planning to quit in the near future (items PES47-PES54). Self-respondents were further queried on smoking policies in their work place (items PES67-PES71), smoking rules in the home (item PES73) and questions on opinions about smoking (items PES72, PES75-PES77).</p><p>Administrative information was collected on who the proxy respondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected includes age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.</p></abstract>

      <abstract>This data collection contains four files of the Clinical
Simulation Test for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, an
instrument developed by the Primary Care Judgements of Nurses and
Physicians Research Project to empirically assess the clinical judgements
of physicians and nurses in relation to chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease in the period 1976-1978. The purpose of the study was to measure
the clinical judgments of health professionals in relation to those of
a panel of eight national experts in the specific area of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. The instrument simulates the clinical
processes from presentation of the chief complaint of a 53-year-old
Caucasian male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease through
diagnoses and treatment. The Clinical Simulation Test (Part 1) was given
to 200 respondents who were divided into six groups: family practice
physicians, nurse practitioners with master's degrees, certified nurse
practitioners, public health nurses, pre-medical students, and nursing
students. The test contains 13 sections and three diagnostic tests.
Nine of the test sections required the respondents to choose from a
list of possible treatment actions. Four sections were open-ended
and required respondents to identify relevant patient data or to list
patient problems. During the process, respondents chose appropriate
procedures from among a wide range of possible choices. Items also include
an evaluation of the test instrument by the respondents, a proficiency
scale which is scored by means of a computer program (Part 2), and the
responses of 2 panels of experts used for the purpose of test instrument
validation (Parts 3 and 4). Demographic items specify age, sex, education,
professional preparation, residency program, specialty, position, and
disease management experience of respondents. See the related collection,

      <abstract source="producer">The data contain records of arrests and bookings for federal offenses in the United States during fiscal year 2002. The data were constructed from the United States Marshals Service (USMS) Prisoner Tracking System database. Records include arrests made by federal law enforcement agencies (including the USMS), state and local agencies, and self-surrenders. Offenders arrested for federal offenses are transferred to the custody of the USMS for processing, transportation, and detention. The Prisoner Tracking System contains data on all offenders within the custody of the USMS. The data file contains variables from the original USMS files as well as additional analysis variables, or "SAF" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 1.1-1.3. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.</abstract>

      <abstract><p>The primary goal of this project was to determine the neurobiologic basis for elevated activity in the contralesional primary motor cortex (PMC). In healthy individuals, unimanual movement (with either the left or right hand) is associated with activity in a network of predominantly contralateral brain regions, including the primary motor cortex. This laterality is often compromised following a middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Neuroimaging studies of these patients have shown that unimanual movements with the effected hand are associated with elevated blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in both the lesioned and the nonlesioned primary motor cortices. Elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is well-established in chronic stroke patients and is associated with poor motor rehabilitation outcomes. Yet the neurobiologic basis for this aberrant neural activity is equivocal.</p>
<p>One factor that may contribute to elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is increased cortical excitatory tone within the contralesional hemisphere. While approximately 80% of the descending corticospinal neurons that control the right hand originate in the left PMC, 20% originate in the right PMC. Elevated activity in the right PMC of left-sided stroke patients may reflect compensatory activity of these descending fibers. Neural activity in the PMC reflects the balance of local excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) processing. It can be measured in two manners: electrophysiologically, using single hemisphere paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and neurochemically, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).</p>
<p>Another factor that may contribute to elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is a loss of transcallosal inhibition between the hemispheres. During right hand movement, the left PMC of healthy individuals actively inhibits the right PMC via inhibitory projections through the corpus callosum. In left MCA stroke patients, elevated activity in the contralesional (right) PMC when moving the right hand may reflect a loss of typical inhibition from the left PMC. The integrity of inter-hemispheric information transfer can be measured in two manners: using bi-hemispheric paired-pulse TMS, and using a multimodal brain stimulation/brain imaging approach, interleaved TMS/MRI. Through interleaved TMS/MRI, researchers can selectively stimulate the ipsilesional PMC and quantify the amount of TMS-induced activity in the contralesional PMC.</p>
<p>These two explanations were tested through a cross-sectional investigation of neural function in left MCA stroke patients with mild-moderate right upper extremity impairment and controls matched for age and cardiovascular risk factors. To assess the clinical relevance of these factors on motor dysfunction, the researchers performed a detailed kinematic assessment of movement efficiency, smoothness and compensation.</p></abstract>
      <abstract><p>The specific aims of this study are: to quantify the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory tone within the contralesional PMC, to quantify the level of information flow between the left and right PMC, and to quantify the relationship between neural activity and performance. The results of these aims will clarify the relative contribution of within and between hemisphere adaptations to cortical reorganization. These cross-sectional data will also be the foundation of a longitudinal R01 that will determine which patterns of laterality predict favorable treatment outcomes. </p></abstract>
      <abstract><p>VISIT 1: Screening. The Screening Visit lasted approximately 2 hours. Individuals were pre-screened for eligibility on the phone by a clinical research assistant with experience working with stroke patients for research studies. Those who met initial inclusion criteria via phone screen visited the laboratory and were asked to provide written informed consent. Participants performed a comprehensive assessment of motor function utilizing the resources and staff of the Quantitative Behavioral Assessment and Rehabilitation (QBAR) Core. Specifically, all stroke patients completed the Rasch modified version of the Fugl-Meyer Motor assessment battery and a kinematic assessment of both unimanual and bimanual movements using a 45 sensor 3D optical imaging system. The three primary measures investigated in the kinematics analyses include: movement efficiency, movement smoothness, and motor compensation.</p>
<p>VISIT 2: Stimulation/Scanning/Written Assessments. Based on the results of Visit 1 assessments, participants that met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in Visit 2. This visit lasted approximately 4 hours. In addition to a series of written psychological questionnaires, individuals received:

      <abstract>The International Social Survey Program (ISSP) is an ongoing program of crossnational collaboration. Formed in 1983, the group develops topical modules dealing with important areas of social science as supplements to regular national surveys. This collection contains data from Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany (East and West), Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, and the United States. Respondents were asked to comment on various topics regarding nature and the environment, including the role of science and scientific solutions to environmental problems, protection of the environment through higher prices of goods or higher taxes, and health issues like exposure to radiation and pollution. In addition, respondents were asked to estimate the effects of nuclear power stations, industrial air pollution, and pesticides used in farming on themselves, their families, and the environment. Additional information was elicited regarding measures respondents were taking to protect the environment, such as whether they drove, recycled, ate meat, lowered the heat when out (during the winter), and turned off lights when leaving a room. Demographic variables include respondent's gender, age, marital status, religion, and party affiliation, as well as education and occupation of the respondent and the respondent's parents and steady life-partner.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This survey was conducted after the summit meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev in Iceland. Respondents were asked to evaluate Reagan's handling of the summit meeting, arms control, and relations with the Soviet Union. They were also asked their opinion of Gorbachev and whether or not the summit would affect which party they would vote for in the upcoming congressional election. In addition, political affiliation, race, and sex were recorded.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study was conducted from October 2002 through July 2003 as a process and impact evaluation of iris recognition technology named T-PASS (Teacher-Parent Authorization Security System) used in three New Egypt schools in New Jersey. The research team observed the use of the iris scanners, both informally (Dataset 1) and formally (Dataset 2), using systematic social observation methods, collected "official" data on school visitation patterns (Dataset 3), and  administered surveys to parents and teachers (Datasets 4-7). The various data collection methods were intended to shed light on two key issues: what was the experience of the schools in implementing iris recognition technology, and what was the overall impact of the technology. Specific variables included in the study are demographic variables on survey respondents (parents and teachers), perceptions of safety and problems in the schools and surrounding neighborhoods, and comparisons of the T-PASS system to alternative entry systems such as the buzzer and swipe card methods.</abstract>
      <abstract>The purpose of the study was to conduct an independent evaluation of the implementation and impact of installing the iris recognition technology in the three schools in Plumsted Township, New Jersey. Specifically, this evaluation was designed to answer the following questions: (1) Did the technology work in a school setting? (2) Did the technology contribute to a reduction in perceptions of violence, or disorder? (3) Did faculty, staff, and parents feel safer? (4) What were the unintended consequences of the technology? and, (5) In what ways might the technology be improved?</abstract>
      <abstract>From October 2002 to July 2003, the researchers conducted a process and impact evaluation of iris recognition technology as used in the three New Egypt schools. The research team observed the use of the iris scanners, both informally (Dataset 1) and formally (Dataset 2), using systematic social observation methods, collected "official" data on school visitation patterns (Dataset 3), and administered surveys to parents and teachers (Datasets 4-7). Teachers, administrators, and staff who agreed to participate in the study were enrolled in the iris technology system and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The treatment group was allowed access to all doors. Parents who agreed to participate were also randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Parents in the treatment group could use the front entrance of the elementary school and would be able to check out their children during school hours by using the iris scanner rather than showing identification and writing out the names of their children on a log sheet. The first wave of teacher and parent surveys were conducted about one month before the iris scanning technology was installed and wave two surveys were conducted near the end of the school year. The first teacher survey was conducted in March 2003 in the Middle School and the Elementary School during an all-staff meeting prior to the school day. Teachers and staff took approximately 10-15 minutes to complete the survey while the research staff waited. School staff who could not attend the meeting or who had to leave early returned the surveys to the secretary for the Assistant Superintendent, who forwarded them to the researchers by mail. In the High School, research staff approached the teachers and staff individually during the school study hall, the teacher's break, and the lunch hours. School secretaries collected extra surveys left for teachers and staff missed due to absences. In June 2003, near the end of the school year, research staff returned and repeated the respective process to administer the second survey to the teachers and staff in the three schools. Wave one survey materials were mailed to parents of students in the Elementary School in February 2003. Parents began the actual enrollment process into the T-PASS system during the first week of March 2003. Parents who wanted to enroll in T-PASS but had not previously volunteered were allowed to do so until the end of March. Seventy-nine additional parents enrolled in T-PASS and received surveys. The researchers mailed one follow-up letter and second copy of the survey to household that enrolled in T-PASS that had not returned surveys. June 2003, the researchers mailed the wave two parents' survey to the 163 households that returned the first survey.</abstract>
      <abstract><p>Dataset 1, the entry log, includes the variables date, time, means of entry (iris scan, buzzer, or other), tailgating scenarios, other means of entry, and if the person tried the door first.</p><p>Dataset 2, the iris scan log, contains the variables date, time, school the person was trying to enter, the location of the entry door, and whether the person was allowed to enter or not.</p><p>Dataset 3, the visitors' log, includes the variables data, time in, time out, and where in the school the visitor was going.</p> <p>The first parent survey, Dataset 4, includes demographic variables such as gender, race, year born, highest level of education, employment status, marital status, number of people in the household, number of people under the age of 18 in the household, grade of the child or children attending New Egypt Elementary School, type of housing, if own or rent, how long the respondent has lived in New Egypt and if it was less than five years, where the respondent lived previously. Other variables in Dataset 4 include the respondent's perception of the level of problems at the school with issues such as bullying, vandalism, fighting, theft, tardiness, absenteeism, weapons, alcohol and drugs. Variables about the neighborhood surrounding the school and if there are problems with theft, vandalism, drugs, sexual assault, simple assault, trash, abandoned vehicles, and traffic are also included. Respondents were asked if they felt their child was safe at school and if the child felt safe at school. Respondents were also asked if they had ever picked up their child from school during school hours, why the child was picked up, and if they thought the visitor sign- in and child sign-out procedures were efficient and sufficient. Other variables were included to gauge the respondents' familiarity with different types of technologies such as cell phones, computers, and voice-mail. Finally, respondents were asked how they learned of the iris recognition program (T-PASS) that was being implemented in the New Egypt Schools.</p><p>Dataset 5, the second parent survey, includes the same variables as Dataset 4, but has additional variables related to the respondents' use of T-PASS and the buzzer system.  Respondents were asked if they had used T-PASS or the buzzer to enter the school, the ease of use of T-PASS and the buzzer, the level of security that was provided by T-PASS and the buzzer, and if they had experienced any problems using either T-PASS or the buzzer.  Respondents were also asked if they had used T-PASS to sign a child out of the school, the ease of use of using T-PASS to sign-out a child, the security level of using T-PASS to sign-out a child, and problems they experienced using T-PASS to sign a child out of the school. </p><p>Dataset 6, the first teacher survey, includes demographic variables such as gender, race, year born, current position, highest level of education, years working in Plumsted Township schools and if less than five years where previously worked. Respondents were asked which school they worked in and if the school had problems with issues such as fighting, absenteeism, tardiness, bullying, theft, vandalism, drug, alcohol or tobacco use by students, and possession of weapons by students. Respondents were asked if they felt safe at the school and in the surrounding neighborhood and if they thought the children felt safe at the school and in surrounding neighborhood. Respondents were asked how many times per day they left the school during school hours, the reason for leaving and if they used a swipe card to enter the building. Variables were also included to gauge the respondents' use of technologies such as cell phones, voice-mail, and computers.  Finally, the respondents were asked how they learned of the iris recognition system (T-PASS) being implemented at the schools.</p><p>The second teacher survey, Dataset 7, includes the same variables as Dataset 6, but has additional variables related to the respondents' use of T-PASS and the buzzer system. Respondents were asked if they had used T-PASS, to compare T-PASS to the buzzer and the swipe card systems in terms of ease of use and level of security provided, and if they had experienced any problems using T-PASS. Respondents were also asked if they had used the buzzer system to enter the school, to compare the buzzer system to T-PASS in terms of ease of use and level of security provided, and if they had any problems while trying to use the buzzer system. Finally, respondents were asked if they had gained entry into the school through other means, and to describe the other means of entry used.</p></abstract>

      <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Leisure, Lifestyle, and Lifecycle Project (LLLP)&lt;/em&gt; is a five-year longitudinal study that was conducted by the Alberta Gambling Research Institute (AGRI). Prior to the LLLP, knowledge of problem gambling risk factors had been derived mainly from cross-sectional and retrospective studies of people coping with disordered gambling. This project was developed with the understanding that prevention and early intervention services for disordered gambling could be better informed by a rigorous longitudinal study of the natural progression of gambling in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In order to examine the determinants and the course of both non-problematic gambling and problem gambling, the LLLP surveys collected data on a number of gambling-specific and general aspects of the responders' lives. The LLLP contains data relating to gambling-specific information, including:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;demographics;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;past year and lifetime gambling behaviour;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;gambling attitudes and beliefs in gambling fallacies;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;motivations for gambling;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;stigma experienced from gambling; and&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;family history of gambling.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to gambling-specific data, the LLLP survey contains a number of general data variables, including:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;general/physical health;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;psychological factors (personality and temperament, psychopathology, coping strategies);&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;comorbid factors (ADHD, eating disorders, substance use disorders);&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;cultural factors (religiosity) and;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;social factors (social support/networks, non-gambling activity participation).&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;A sample of 1,808 participants was recruited from four diverse regions of Alberta: Edmonton, Calgary, Lethbridge, and Grand Prairie. Participants were recruited primarily by random digit dialing, and five critical age ranges were targeted (13-15, 18-20, 23-25, and 63-65 year-olds) in order to assess problem gambling development throughout the lifespan. There are two separate LLLP datasets: one for adolescents (&lt;em&gt;n=&lt;/em&gt;436) and another for adults (&lt;em&gt;n=&lt;/em&gt;1,372). Data were collected over four waves, with a retention rate of 71.8% for adolescents and 76.2% for adults. A subsequent wave, combining adolescent and adult participants, was undertaken in 2013-2014. Additional information on sampling, retention, study variables, and survey questionnaires can be located in the &lt;em&gt;LLLP User Manual&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

      <abstract>This data collection is the result of a project established
to study the development, implementation, and use of statewide
sentencing guidelines and to report the perceptions of criminal
justice system personnel and inmates regarding those
guidelines. Funded by the National Institute of Law Enforcement and
Criminal Justice, the project was carried out by the Rutgers
University School of Criminal Justice from October 1978 to June
1981. Additional data produced by this project are contained in two
other studies held by ICPSR: MASSACHUSETTS STATEWIDE STATEWIDE
CRIMINAL JUSTICE GUIDELINES EVALUATION, 1979: SENTENCTING DATA (ICPSR
7909) and NEW JERSEY STATEWIDE CRIMINAL JUSTICE GUIDELINES EVALUATION,
1980: INMATE SURVEY DATA (ICPSR 7911). The data in this study is
contained in two files. It consists of interviews to determine the
opinions of inmates about the relative seriousness of offenses,
severity of punishments, appropriateness of penalties for various
kinds of crimes, and the use of sentencing guidelines to structure
judicial sentencing decisions. Part 1, Inmate Background Data,
contains socioeconomic, residential, and current and prior criminal
history information in a random sample of 226 Rahway, New Jersey,
State Prison inmates. Background information was collected for all of
the inmates selected to participate in the 1979 New Jersey inmate
survey. However, not all of those inmates selected agreed to be
interviewed when the actual survey was conducted. Therefore, Part 1
includes information on survey respondents and nonrespondents. Part 2,
Inmate Survey Data, contains information on 146 inmates. Frequency
distributions and the survey instrument are included in the
documentation.</abstract>

      <abstract>
The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released.

The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these.

LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. 

These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector.

      <abstract source="producer">For this panel survey a national sample of high school
seniors and their parents were interviewed in 1965, and again in 1973
and 1982. The survey gauges the impact of life-stage events and
historical trends on the behaviors and attitudes of respondents. Each
wave has a distinct focus. The 1965 data focus on high school
experiences, while the 1973 data deal with the protest era. Data
gathered in 1982 emphasize the maturing process and offer information
relating to parental issues and family relationships. Other major areas
of investigation include political participation, issue positions,
group evaluations, civic orientations, personal change over time,
stability in attitudes and behaviors over time, and partisanship and
electoral behavior.</abstract>

December 31, 1999, and a count of the number entering and leaving
supervision during the year. The survey also provides counts of the number of parolees by certain characteristics, such as gender, race and Hispanic or Latino origin, supervision status, and cause of death. This survey covers all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Federal System.</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Note aux usagers:  &lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Statistique Canada a confirmé, le 10 mai 2018, que certains codes postaux sont absents de l'édition du FCCP de décembre 2017. Aucuns details spécifiques sont disponibles pour expliquer ces absences. Cependant, les codes postaux absents sont disponibles dans la plus récente édition du FCCP, notamment l'édition d'août 2018.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le Fichier de conversion des codes postaux (FCCP) est un fichier numérique qui permet d’établir un lien entre les codes postaux à six caractères fournit par la Société canadienne des postes (SCP) et les unités géographiques normalisées de Statistique Canada pour lesquelles les données du recensement et d’autres statistiques sont produites. Les liens entre les codes postaux et les unités géographiques normalisées font du FCCP un outil permettant d’intégrer des données de diverses sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voici un guide pour&lt;a href="http://odesi2.scholarsportal.info/documentation/PCCF/census_years/2016/dec2017/Getting_Started_fra_dec2017.html" target="blank"&gt; comment commencer. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour obtenir le fichier de conversion des codes postaux ou pour des questions, consultez &lt;a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/fra/idd/contact" target="_blank"&gt;la personne-ressource IDD&lt;/a&gt; de votre établissement d'enseignement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les coordonnées géographiques attribuées à chaque code postal dans le FCCP sont généralement utilisées pour cartographier la distribution des données aux fins d’analyse spatiale (p. ex., les clients, les activités). Les renseignements sur la localisation s’avèrent un outil puissant aux fins de planification ou de recherche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C’est en avril 1983 que la Division de la géographie a diffusé une première version du FCCP qui établissait un lien entre les codes postaux et les unités géographiques du recensement et comprenait des coordonnées géographiques. Depuis, le fichier a été actualisé de façon périodique afin de refléter les changements.Pour la présente édition du FCCP, la majorité des codes postaux ont été directement géocodés aux régions géographiques du Recensement de 2016. Cette technique a permis d’améliorer la précision du fichier obtenu par comparaison avec le procedé de conversion, précedemment utilisé les codes postaux ont, pour la plupart, été géocodés à la géographie du Recensement de 2016. Par comparaison avec le procédé de conversion précédemment utilisé (pour aligner les appariements entre les codes postaux et les nouvelles régions géographiques à l'issue de chaque recensement) cette technique permet d'améliorer la précision du fichier obtenu. &lt;/p&gt;

The International Travel Survey (ITS) is an ongoing survey conducted by Statistics Canada since the 1920s to
meet the requirements of the Canadian System of National Accounts (Balance of Payments (BOP)). Through
the years, the need for detailed characteristics of travellers for market research and industry planning was
gradually incorporated in the survey. Today, the ITS provides a full range of statistics on the volume of
international travellers and detailed characteristics of their trips such as expenditures, activities, places visited
and length of stay.

The ITS covers both Canadian residents returning from trips outside Canada and international visitors to
Canada. In addition to fulfilling BOP requirements, the ITS is also being used by the Tourism Satellite
Account (TSA), Customs Canada, the Canadian tourism Commission (CTC), provincial tourism agencies, the
United States Department of Commerce and a number of private sector industries. The ITS is also used for
reporting to international organizations such as the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Pacific-Asia Tourism Association.

      <abstract>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a part of the Decennial Census Program, and is designed to produce critical information about the characteristics of local communities. The ACS publishes social, housing, and economic characteristics for demographic groups covering a broad spectrum of geographic areas in the United States and Puerto Rico. Every year the ACS supports the release of single-year estimates for geographic areas with populations of 65,000 or more. Demographic variables include sex, age, relationship, households by type, race, and Hispanic origin. Social characteristics variables include school enrollment, educational attainment, marital status, fertility, grandparents caring for children, veteran status, disability status, residence one year ago, place of birth, United States citizenship status, year of entry, world region of birth of foreign born, language spoken at home, and ancestry. Variables focusing on economic characteristics include employment status, commuting to work, occupation, industry, class of worker, income and benefits, and poverty status. Variables focusing on housing characteristics include occupancy, units in structure, year structure was built, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, housing tenure, year householder moved into unit, vehicles available, house heating fuel, utility costs, occupants per room, housing value, and mortgage status. The American Community Survey is conducted under the authority of Title 13, United States Code, Sections 141 and 193, and response is mandatory.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
 (PHDCN) was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families,
 schools, and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent development.
 One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which
 was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over
 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and
 their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing
 circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,
 that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
 behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to
 gauge various aspects of human development, including individual
 differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One such
 measure was the Family Mental Health and Legal History assessment,
 administered to the primary caregivers of subjects belonging to
 Cohorts 0 to 18. It included questions designed to obtain family
 members' history of psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and any
involvement with the law.</abstract>

 <p>The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN)
 was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families, schools,
 and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent development. It was
 designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of
 both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the
 project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,
 adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the
 project provided a detailed look at the environments in which these
 social behaviors took place by collecting substantial amounts of data
 about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and
 resources.</p>
 <p><hi>Longitudinal Cohort Study</hi></p>
 <p>One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which
 was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over
 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and
 their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing
 circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,
 that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
 behaviors. The age cohorts include birth (0), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18
 years. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to gauge
 various aspects of human development, including individual
 differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences.</p>
 <p><hi>Family Mental Health and Legal History</hi></p>
 <p>The Family Mental Health and Legal History instrument was
 administered in order to report on characteristics of the subject's
 family. The data files contain information from this protocol, which
 was designed to provide a family history of mental health and
 legal-related issues such as history of depression, suicide, substance
abuse, and involvement with the law.</p></abstract>
      <abstract><p><hi>Project on Human Development in Chicago 
 Neighborhoods</hi></p>
 <p>The city of Chicago was selected as the research site for the PHDCN
 because of its extensive racial, ethnic, and social-class diversity.
 The project collapsed 847 census tracts in the city of Chicago into
 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon seven groupings of
 racial/ethnic composition and three levels of socioeconomic status.
 The NCs were designed to be ecologically meaningful. They were
 composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic
 boundaries and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered in
 the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately
 8,000 people.</p>
 <p><hi>Longitudinal Cohort Study</hi></p>
 <p>For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample
 of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21
 strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with
 the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to
 eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic
 status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected
 at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing
 of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.
 Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts
 (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through
 in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the
 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within
 six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were
 selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of
 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the
 eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.</p>
 <p>For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the
 child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to
 spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research
 assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child
 interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face
 interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the
 personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews
 were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete
 protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was
 hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,
 Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,
 participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other
 incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly
 drawing prizes were also included.</p>
 <p>Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For
 example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking
 traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,
 delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and
 self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also
 interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,
 parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental
 health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.</p>
 <p><hi>Family Mental Health and Legal History</hi></p>
 <p>Administered between 1994 and 1997, the Family Mental Health and
 Legal History instrument was completed by primary caregivers of
 subjects belonging to Cohorts 0 to 18 of the PHDCN Longitudinal Cohort
 Study. Respondents answered either "Yes" or "No" to questions
 inquiring about the family's history with alcohol and drug abuse,
 depression, nervous breakdowns, suicide, frequent fighting, trouble
 keeping a job, and frequent discipline problems. For each "Yes"
 response, respondents also provided the family member's relation to
 the subject (e.g., biological, nonbiological, maternal, paternal, or
 parent, sibling, aunt, uncle, grandparent, or other). Up to 15 family
 members could have been mentioned for each question asked. The
 instrument was also used to gather information on treatment and
 hospitalization for substance abuse or emotional problems. For those
 family members mentioned as having a history of mental health issues,
 questions were asked concerning any trouble they may have had with the
 police, if they had ever been arrested, and whether they were serving
any time in a jail or prison.</p></abstract>
      <abstract>In addition to the variables containing the
 responses to the Family Mental Health and Legal History instrument,
 the data contain administrative variables that record identification
 numbers for respondents and interviewers, cohort, and wave number, as
well as the time and date each interview was completed.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This research program was undertaken in Indiana to evaluate 
 the effectiveness of legislation that prohibited "happy hours," the 
 sale of alcoholic beverages at reduced prices during specified times. 
 The happy hour ban sought to curb abusive drinking that can occur when 
 alcoholic beverages are served at significantly reduced prices for a 
 limited time only. The goal of the data collection was to determine 
 whether any reduction in automobile accidents could be attributed to 
 the ban on happy hours. Researchers used an interrupted time-series 
 design to observe trends over time. Data used in this evaluation were 
 extracted from the Accident Statistical Master Tapes for 1983 through 
 1986 for the state of Indiana, which include annual compilations of all 
 accidents. Variables measure the number of accidents during the 
 specified times. The first data file has as its unit of analysis weeks, 
 defined as beginning Monday and ending on Friday. The second data file 
has as its unit of analysis bi-weekly periods.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This poll, fielded March 28 to April 02, 2008, is a part of a continuing series of monthly surveys that solicit public opinion on the presidency and on a range of other political and social issues. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling the presidency and the economy, the most important problem facing the nation, and how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign. Several questions addressed the economy and sought opinions on the condition of the national economy, the most important economic problem facing the nation, whether the United States was in an economic recession and whether the economy was getting better or worse. Registered voters were asked whether they were more likely to vote in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus, which candidate they supported and why, who they expected to win the Democratic nomination, their opinions of the candidates, and for whom they would vote if the election was held that day. Views were also sought on Senator Barack Obama's former minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright's statements and whether his statements affected the respondent's opinions of Obama. Respondents were asked how concerned they were about several aspects of their personal finances including being able to afford health care, housing, and retirement costs, college tuition, and whether they were concerned about their job security. Respondents were also asked about their biggest economic concern, whether they were getting ahead financially, whether they had made cutbacks in their spending, and whether rises in food prices was affecting them. Additional questions asked respondents whether they had any close friends or relatives who filed for bankruptcy or had a foreclosure in the past year, whether they had any money invested in the stock market, and whether they thought investment in the stock market was safe.  Other topics addressed the war in Iraq, the home mortgage crisis, estate and income tax, trade restrictions, and race relations. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, employment status, marital status, whether respondents had children under 18 years of age, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian.</abstract>

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The "Sysmiss" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the "Valid" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>SSTF 1 contains sample data weighted to represent the total 
 population. In addition, the file contains 100-percent counts and 
 unweighted sample counts for total persons and total housing units in 
 the 1990 Census. Population variables include citizenship, ability to 
 speak English, age, number of children ever born, class of worker, 
 disability status, earnings in 1989, educational attainment, employment 
 status, household size, industry, labor force status, language spoken 
 at home, occupation, poverty status in 1989, school enrollment, and 
 year of entry into the United States. Housing variables include gross 
 rent, housing units, kitchen facilities, mortgage status, plumbing 
 facilities, tenure, units in structure, and year householder moved into 
 unit. The data are also crosstabulated and presented in a variety of 
 tables. Crosstabulations include citizenship and year of entry by all 
 other variables, age (groups) by sex by school enrollment or college 
 enrollment or educational attainment and employment status, age by 
 poverty status by sex, relationship by family type by subfamily type, 
 and employment status by hours worked last week and year last worked. 
 The dataset includes both "A" and "B" records. "A" records have 
 three population (PA) and three housing (HA) tables. The "B" records 
 present more detail in 66 population (PB) and 10 housing (HB) tables, 
and are divided into 22 segments of 8,142 characters each.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">The basic purpose of the National Health Interview Survey 
 (NHIS) is to obtain information about the amount and distribution of 
 illness, its effects in terms of disability and chronic impairments, 
 and the kinds of health services people receive. The purpose of this 
 supplement was to determine the general level of public awareness about 
 ways to prevent injuries to children and adults and methods used to 
 accomplish this. Questions were also included about breast-feeding. The 
 supplement contains approximately 100 variables from the core file (see 
 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY, 1990 [ICPSR 9839]), including sex, 
 age, race, marital status, veteran status, education, income, industry 
 and occupation codes, household safety, and limits on activity. 
 Variables unique to this supplement include whether respondents had 
 heard of poison control centers, whether they had the telephone number 
 to a poison control center, whether they had ipecac syrup in the house, 
 whether they knew about child safety seats, whether a doctor told them 
 about using child safety seats, whether they used a car safety seat 
 when leaving the hospital after the baby's birth, whether the child 
 currently had a car safety seat, whether the child was buckled into a 
 car safety seat, whether the child wore a seat belt, if the child was 
 ever breast-fed, and the age of the child when breast-feeding was 
completely stopped.</abstract>

      <abstract>The objective of the SUPPORT and HELP projects was to
improve decision-making in order to address the growing national
concern over the loss of control that patients have near the end of
life and to reduce the frequency of a mechanical, painful, and
prolonged process of dying. SUPPORT comprised a two-year prospective
observational study (Phase I) followed by a two-year controlled
clinical trial (Phase II). Phase I of SUPPORT collected data from
patients accessioned during 1989-1991 to characterize the care,
treatment preferences, and patterns of decision-making among
critically ill patients. It also served as a preliminary step for
devising an intervention strategy for improving critically-ill
patients' care and for the construction of statistical models for
predicting patient prognosis and functional status. An intervention
was implemented in Phase II of SUPPORT, which accessioned patients
during 1992-1994. The Phase II intervention provided physicians with
accurate predictive information on future functional ability, survival
probability to six months, and patients' preferences for end-of-life
care. Additionally, a skilled nurse was provided as part of the
intervention to elicit patient preferences, provide prognoses, enhance
understanding, enable palliative care, and facilitate advance
planning. The intervention was expected to increase communication,
resulting in earlier decisions to have orders against resuscitation,
decrease time that patients spent in undesirable states (e.g., in the
Intensive Care Unit, on a ventilator, and in a coma), increase
physician understanding of patients' preferences for care, decrease
patient pain, and decrease hospital resource use. Data collection in
both phases of SUPPORT consisted of questionnaires administered to
patients, their surrogates, and physicians, plus chart reviews for
abstracting clinical, treatment, and decision information. Phase II
also collected information regarding the implementation of the
intervention, such as patient-specific logs maintained by nurses
assigned to patients as part of the intervention. SUPPORT patients
were followed for six months after inclusion in the study. Those who
did not die within six months or were lost to follow-up were matched
against the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997. The
HELP study was conducted in 1993 concomitantly with Phase II of
SUPPORT and collected data to characterize the care, treatment
preferences, and patterns of decision-making among hospitalized
patients who were at least 80 years old. HELP data were also intended
for use in adapting existing mortality and functional status models of
elderly hospitalized patients. Data collection methods of HELP were
essentially the same as those of SUPPORT. HELP patients were followed
for 12 months after inclusion in the study. Patients who did not die
within one year or were lost to follow-up were matched against the
National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997.</abstract>

      <abstract>
The Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CTADS) is a biennial general population survey of tobacco, alcohol and drug use among Canadians aged 15 years and older. It replaces the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey (CTUMS), which was conducted from 1999 to 2012, and the Canadian Alcohol and Drug Use Monitoring Survey (CADUMS), which was conducted from 2008 to 2012. The CTADS merged the core tobacco content from CTUMS and the core drug and alcohol content from CADUMS, resulting in more efficient data collection and providing a tool to monitor and compare the use of multiple products and substances with addictive properties. The CTADS is conducted by Statistics Canada on behalf of Health Canada.

&lt;p&gt;The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is conducted annually to obtain work experience and income information from Canadian households. The Survey provides up-to-date information on the distribution and sources of income, before and after taxes, for families and individuals. With this file, users may identify specific family types, such as two-parent and lone-parent families. Information is also provided on earnings, transfers, and total income for the head and the spouse of the census family unit, as well as personal and labour-related characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference year for this file is 1979.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commencing with the 1998 microdata files, annual cross-sectional income data will be sourced from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID).&lt;/p&gt;

Sexual Assault Response Teams (SARTs) are interventions that were created to coordinate efforts of the legal, medical, mental health systems, and rape crisis centers, in order to improve victims' help seeking experiences and legal outcomes. This study examined the relationship between SART structure and effectiveness by conducting a national scale study of SARTs and a smaller detailed network analysis of four SARTs.

The purpose of Study 1 National Survey was to conduct a national-scale study of Sexual Assault Response Teams (SARTs) in order to:
</p>
<list type="ordered">
<itm>
Understand the structure and functioning of United States SARTs.
</itm>
<itm>
Identify patterns of SART implementation.
</itm>
<itm>
Examine how these different patterns relate to perceived effectiveness at improvements in legal practice and outcomes.
</itm>

<p>
The purpose of Study 2 Network Analysis was to examine patterns of collaborative relationships within model SARTs:
</p>
<list type="ordered">
<itm>
To understand the nature and distribution of each of these types of inter-organizational relationships within model SARTs. For example, are SARTs characterized by many or few inter-organizational relationships? Do organizations in SARTs tend to have relationships that are reciprocated? Are relationships centered around a focal organization or group of organizations?
</itm>
<itm>
To understand the associations between these types of inter-organizational relationships. In other words, within SARTs, do inter-organizational relationships tend to be similar across networks of communication frequency, feeling valued by other organizations, and valuing other organizations' work?

For Study 1 National Survey random sampling methods were used to identify a nationally representative sample of n=172 SARTs which engaged in multidisciplinary coordination in the response to sexual assault, meet regularly, and responding to adult sexual assault victims. A semi-structured phone interview was conducted with a key informant, such as a SART leader or coordinator, asking them to provide information about both their perceptions of SARTs' effectiveness, and structural characteristics of their SART. The interview asked specific questions on membership breadth, such as the number of different stakeholder groups that participated in the collaboration; aspects of implementation, such as their use of formal resources and structures to organize their work; and extent to which they institutionalize various collaborative activities into their teamwork in order to promote change. Based on these features, cluster analysis was used to empirically derive patterns of SART implementation.
</p>
<p>
Study 2 Network Analysis sought to deepen the understanding of how SART structure relates to SART perceived effectiveness by examining the structure of inter-organizational relationships within SARTs. Based on Study 1 results, four model SARTs (high use of formal structures and institutionalization of collaborative activities, and all engaging in program evaluation) were sampled. Phone interviews were conducted with a key informant from each of the members of the SART. Three types of collaborative relationships were assessed: inter-organizational communication about coordinating the response to sexual assault, believing that other organizations value their organizations role in the response to sexual assault, and believing that other organizations are a resource to their organization's work in responding to sexual assault. Researchers employed social network analysis to study these inter-organizational relationships.

Study 1 National Survey (n=172) contains 120 variables on: SART's operational history; respondent's demographics, education level, and title and tenure in the SART; which groups the SART represents; number of members in the SART; organization structure and formalization, such as existence of written mission statement, recorded meeting minutes, formal procedures and bylaws; use of program evaluation; institutionalization of case review, cross training, and policy/protocols; SART's effectiveness in victims engagement with investigation, producing evidence, willingness to prosecute, and engagement with court officials; SART's effectiveness in improving support for victims in criminal justice process, quality of forensic evidence, knowledge and utilization of medical evidence by the police and prosecutors, law enforcement's investigations, police and prosecutors building rapport with victims, medical personnel's expert witness testimony, and prosecutors preparing victims for testimony; whether SART's efforts led to victims more likely to receive referrals to medical, mental health, and advocacy services; whether SART's efforts led to responders providing better service to victims and being more sensitive toward victims; whether SART's efforts lead to victims having more positive experience with legal systems, medical systems, health systems, and advocacy; region the SART is located; participant's stakeholder group; legal effectiveness of victim participation, prosecution, and police; and cluster analysis dummy variables.
</p>
<p>
Study 2 Network Analysis is composed of sets of 4 files containing SART networking data prepared for network analysis, one for each of the 4 sampled SARTs.
</p>
<list>
<itm>
Raw Data files are the raw data coded from the interviews and contains variables on respondent's gender, age, race, and education level, respondent's opinion on how other members valued his/her organization's role and value of other organizations to his/her organization's work, and SART's communication frequency with other members of the SART.
</itm>
<itm>
Continuous Data files are the Raw Data files prepared for data analysis by agglomerating data for organizations with multiple respondents. They contain variables on respondent's opinion on how other members valued his/her organization's role and value of other organizations to his/her organization's work, and organization's communication frequency with other members of the SART.
</itm>
<itm>
Positive vs. Negative or Non-Existent Relationship files are derived from the Continuous Data files with the variables dichotomized to simple positive/negative markers. They contain variables on respondent's opinion on how other members valued his/her organization's role and value of other organizations to his/her organization's work, and organization's communication frequency with other members of the SART.
</itm>
<itm>
Attributes Data files contain variables on whether the respondent's organization is a primary or tertiary responder, whether it provides social/medical services or is part of the criminal justice system, and if the organization serves more than one county.

      <abstract>
The Travel Survey of Residents of Canada (TSRC) is a major source of data used to measure the size and status of Canada's tourism industry. It was developed to quantify the volume, the characteristics and the economic impact of domestic travel. For the system of national accounts, TSRC measures the size of domestic travel in Canada from the demand side. 

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2005, the TRSC replaces the Canadian Travel Survey (CTS). Featuring several definitional changes and a new questionnaire, this survey provides estimates of domestic travel that are more in line with the international guidelines recommended by the World Tourism Organization (WTO) and the United Nations Statistical Commission. Please see Appendix D for differences between the CTS and the TSRC. In 2011, the TRSC underwent a redesign. Please see Appendix C for the differences between the 2006-2010 TSRC and the redesign 2011 TSRC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TSRC is sponsored by Statistics Canada, the Canadian Tourism Commission, the provincial governments, two federal organizations and a consortium of Canadian cities. The objectives of the survey are: 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
to provide information about the volume of trips, visits and expenditures for Canadian residents by trip origin, destination, duration, type of accommodation used, trip reason, mode of travel, etc.;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; to provide information on travel incidence; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to provide the socio-demographic profile of travellers and non-travellers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates allow quarterly analysis at the national, provincial and tourism region level (with varying degrees of precision) on: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; total volume of same-day and overnight trips taken by Canadians in Canada or with an international destination where at least one night of the trip was spent in Canada. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;same-day and overnight visits in Canada &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;main purpose of the trip/key activities done while on trip &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spending on same-day and overnight trips taken in Canada by Canadian residents in total and by category of expenditure, modes of transportation (main/other) used on the trip &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visits and spending in total and by expense category for each location visited in Canada (a location is defined as either the main destination, or a place where 1 or more nights was spent) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nights spent in each location visited in Canada, in total and by type of accommodation used &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of travel packages and associated spending and source of payment (household, public and private employer) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; demographics of adults that took or did not take any trips &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;travel party composition &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three files for this survey - Trip File, Visit File, and Person File.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the Preliminary version (released January 2013) and the Final version (released March 2013) is the geography variables: the Tourism Region variable was removed from the Final version.&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt; L'Enquête sur la population active (EPA) fournit des estimations de l'emploi et du chômage, lesquelles figurent parmi les mesures les plus actuelles et les plus importantes de la performance de l'économie canadienne.  Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L'EPA, conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées (des employés), des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; L'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le secteur public ou privé, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage.  D’autres sujets incluent les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail.  Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Il s'agit d'un fichier mensuel, et les données disponibles remontent à 1976. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pour une liste complète et une description des variables de l'EPA, veuillez consulter le Guide de l'Enquête sur la population active, disponible sous la section Questionnaire(s) et guide(s) de déclaration ci-dessus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note : &lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;
Puisque les valeurs manquantes sont retirées de cette série de données, toute forme de non-réponse (ex. enchaînement valide, non déclaré, ne sait pas, refus) ne peut être identifiée comme manquante. L'étiquette &lt;/em&gt;« Sysmiss »&lt;/em&gt; dans la section statistiques indique le nombre d'enregistrements de non-réponse pour chacune des variables, tandis que la valeur « Valid » indique le nombre d'enregistrements de réponses pour chacune des variables. Pour chacune des variables, le total d'enregistrements comprend les valeurs « Sysmiss » ainsi que &lt;/em&gt;« Valid »&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Révision de l'Enquête sur la population active (EPA): Les estimations de l'EPA étaient auparavant basées sur les estimations de la population du Recensement de 2006. Dorénavant, les données de l'EPA ont été rétroactivement ajustées jusqu'en 2001, pour refléter les estimations de la population du Recensement de 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract source="producer">This special topic poll, fielded November 17, 1994, was 
 undertaken to assess public opinion on the issue of crime control and 
 prison management. Respondents were asked what they believed was the 
 most important problem facing the country and whether they believed 
 that the federal government could do anything to resolve the problem 
 of crime. Those surveyed were asked if they favored longer sentences 
 for repeat offenders and if they would support the building of more 
 prisons even if their taxes would increase as a result. Respondents 
 were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with certain statements 
 regarding progress in the crime problem and other issues. Additional 
 questions asked respondents if they thought violent crime in the 
 country was going up or down and if they were willing to give up 
 freedoms to reduce crime and violence. The results of the poll were 
 announced on the television program "Nightline." Background variables 
include political affiliation and sex.</abstract>

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Travel Survey of Residents of Canada (TSRC) is a major source of data used to measure the size and status of Canada's tourism industry. It was developed to mesure the volume, the characteristics and the economic impact of domestic travel. Since the beginning of 2005 this survey replaces the Canada Travel Survey (CTS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It measures the size of domestic travel in Canada from the demand side. The objectives of the survey are to provide information about the volume of trips and expenditures for Canadian residents by trip origin, destination, duration, type of accommodation used, trip reason, mode of travel, etc.; to provide information on travel incidence and to provide the socio-demographic profile of travellers and non-travellers. Estimates allow quarterly analysis at the national, provincial and tourism region level (with varying degrees of precision) on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total volume of same-day and overnight trips taken by the residents of Canada with destinations in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;same-day and overnight visits in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;main purpose of the trip/key activities on trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spending on same-day and overnight trips taken in Canada by Canadian residents in total and by category of expenditure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modes of transportation (main/other) used on the trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person-visits, household-visits, spending in total and by expense category for each location visited in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person- and party-nights spent in each location visited in Canada, in total and by type of accommodation used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of travel packages and associated spending and use of motor coach/other guided tours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source of payment (household, government, private employer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demographics of adults that took or did not take trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;travel party composition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three files for this survey - Trip File, Visit File, and Person File.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TSRC is an independant supplemnet to the Labour Force Survey (LFS).&lt;/p&gt;

different samples of primary and secondary school students from Kenya
and the country's capital, Nairobi. Four separate questionnaires were
used, one for each sample. Although they basically probed the same
issues, the secondary school questionnaires were able to explore
attitudes in greater depth and to investigate the degree of racial and
religious prejudices. The study focused on feelings of the student
toward the teacher and the educational system, trust in others,
attitudes toward the political system, and the respondents' conception
of the relationship between the educational system and the economic
and political systems. Several questions attempted to assess whether
the students believed that an education would help them in the future
with respect to employment, influencing the government, and being a
good citizen. Background data such as age, race, religion, and
education of parents were also collected.</abstract>

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The "Sysmiss" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the "Valid" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LFS revisions: 
LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. &lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract source="producer">Nearly 9 million Americans live in extreme-poverty neighborhoods, places that also tend to be racially segregated and dangerous. Yet, the effects on the well-being of residents of moving out of such communities into less distressed areas remain uncertain. Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is a randomized housing experiment administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that gave low-income families living in high-poverty areas in five cities the chance to move to lower-poverty areas. Families were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) the low-poverty voucher (LPV) group (also called the experimental group) received Section 8 rental assistance certificates or vouchers that they could use only in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10 percent. The families received mobility counseling and help in leasing a new unit. One year after relocating, families could use their voucher to move again if they wished, without any special constraints on location; (2) the traditional voucher (TRV) group (also called the Section 8 group) received regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers that they could use anywhere; these families received no special mobility counseling; (3) the control group received no certificates or vouchers through MTO, but continued to be eligible for project-based housing assistance and whatever other social programs and services to which they would otherwise be entitled. Families were tracked from baseline (1994-1998) through the long-term evaluation survey fielding period (2008-2010) with the purpose of determining the effects of "neighborhood" on participating families. This data collection includes data from the 3,273 adult interviews completed as part of the MTO long-term evaluation. Using data from the long-term evaluation, the associated article reports that moving from a high-poverty to lower-poverty neighborhood was associated in the long-term (10 to 15 years) with modest, but potentially important, reductions in the prevalence of extreme obesity and diabetes. The data contain all outcomes and mediators analyzed for the associated article (with the exception of a few mediator variables from the interim MTO evaluation) as well as a variety of demographic and other baseline measures that were controlled for in the analysis.</abstract>

Note : Étant donné que les valeurs manquantes n'apparaissent pas dans ces ensembles de données, toute forme de non-réponse (e.g. saut valide, indéterminé) ou ne sais pas/refus ne peuvent pas être codées comme manquantes. L'étiquette "Sysmiss" dans la section statistique indique le nombre de records non-réponse pour chacune des variables et la valeur "valide" dans la section des statistiques indique que le nombre de records de répondants pour chaque variable. Le nombre total de records pour chaque variable est compris dans les deux, soit le "Symiss" et dans les "valeurs valides"

L'Enquête sur la population active (EPA) fournit des estimations de l'emploi et du chômage, lesquelles figurent parmi les mesures les plus actuelles et les plus importantes de la performance de l'économie canadienne. Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.

L'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. 

Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.

Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.

      <abstract>
The first quarter was conducted in November 1996 as a supplement to the Labour Force Survey. Currently, Bell Canada and other companies, through Stentor Resource Centre Inc, are negotiating local service pricing options for phone rates with the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunication Commission. Penetration rates are the most reliable indicator of affordability as there is no price range that can be identified as affordable or not affordable. As a result, the importance of monitoring any changes in phone penetration rates and analysing the reasons for non-subscribers is necessary to properly guide regulators in decisions about rate increases, decreases or subsidies.

This public use microdata file contains non-aggregated data for a wide variety of variables collected from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS collects monthly information on the labour market activities of Canada's working age population. This product is for users who prefer to do their own analysis by focusing on specific subgroups in the population or by cross-classifying variables that are not in our catalogued products.

This file contains both personal characteristics for all individuals in the household and detailed labour force characteristics for household members 15 years of age and over. The personal characteristics include age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Detailed labour force characteristics include employment information such as class of worker, usual and actual hours of work, employee hourly and weekly wages, industry and occupation of current or most recent job, public and private sector, union status, paid or unpaid overtime hours, job permanency, hours of work lost, job tenure, and unemployment information such as duration of unemployment, methods of job search and type of job sought. Labour force characteristics are also available for students during the school year and during the summer months as well as school attendance whether full or part-time and the type of institution. These and more are available by province and for the three largest census metropolitan areas (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver).

This is a monthly file, and is available going back to 1976.

LFS revisions: LFS estimates have been adjusted to reflect population counts based on the 2011 Census and includes updates to 2011 Geography classification system and were revised back to 2001.

      <abstract>The Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) from the 1980 Census 
 contain person- and household-level information from the "long-form" 
 questionnaires distributed to a sample of the population enumerated in 
 the 1980 Census. The C Sample identifies census regions, divisions, 27 
 individual states, and the District of Columbia. Four types of areas 
 are shown: inside central cities, urban fringe, other urban, and rural. 
 The C Sample separately identifies every urbanized area with a total 
 population over 800,000, and roughly half of the urbanized areas 
 between 200,000 and 800,000. As a percentage of the 1-percent Public 
 Use Microdata Sample (C Sample) [CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING, 1980 
 [UNITED STATES]: PUBLIC USE MICRODATA SAMPLE (C SAMPLE): 1-PERCENT 
 SAMPLE], this file constitutes a 1-in-1000 sample, and contains all 
 household- and person-level variables from the original C Sample. 
 Household-level variables include housing tenure, year structure was 
 built, number and types of rooms in dwelling, plumbing facilities, 
 heating equipment, taxes and mortgage costs, number of children, and 
 household and family income. Person-level variables include sex, age, 
 marital status, race, Spanish origin, income, occupation, 
transportation to work, and education.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">The ANES 2010 Panel Recontact Study is a reinterview of the ANES 2008-2009 Panel Study panelists. Those who previously completed at least one ANES wave of the Panel Study before November 2008 and who also completed the November 2008 (post-election) wave were invited to complete a follow-up interview in June 2010. Data collection ended in July 2010. The study was conducted entirely on the Internet from a sample selected and recruited by telephone. It represents United States citizens aged 18 years or older as of election day in November 2008. The questions on the recontact survey covered numerous topics. Many questions were previously asked on earlier waves of the ANES 2008-2009 Panel Study.

      <abstract><p>The Afrobarometer is a comparative series of public attitude surveys that collects and disseminates data regarding Africans' views on democracy, governance, the economy, civil society, and related issues. This particular data collection was concerned with the attitudes and opinions of the citizens of Tunisia, and also includes a number of "country-specific questions" designed specifically for the Tunisia survey.</p>
<p>The data are collected from nationally representative samples in face-to-face interviews in the language of the respondent's choice. Standard topics for the Afrobarometer include attitudes toward and evaluations of democracy, governance and economic conditions, political participation, and national identity. In addition, Round 6 surveys included special modules on taxation; tolerance; crime, conflict and insecurity; political corruption; interregional relations; perceptions of China; use of technology;  and social service delivery. Country-specific topics include the Arab Spring and terrorism. </p>
<p>The surveys also collect a large set of socio-demographic indicators such as age, gender, education level, poverty level, language and ethnicity, and religious affiliation, as well as political party affiliation. Afrobarometer Round 6 surveys were implemented in 36 countries. </p></abstract>

Cette enquête a pour objectif de suivre les changements du statut de fumeur, en particulier chez les personnes les plus à risque comme les jeunes de 15 à 24 ans. Elle permet également à Santé Canada d'évaluer la prévalence de l'usage de la cigarette parmi le groupe d'âge des 15 à 24 ans et celui des 25 ans et plus, selon la province et le sexe, et ce, deux fois par année.

      <abstract source="producer">The Community Healthy Marriage Initiative (CHMI) evaluation was designed to evaluate community-level impacts of various relationship and marriage education programs. This study compared three sites which received grant funding from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) (Dallas, Texas; St. Louis, Missouri; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin) with three cities that did not receive grant-funding (Fort Worth, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; and Cleveland, Ohio) to determine what impacts grant funding has on these types of programs. This collection includes two rounds of surveys, one conducted in 2007 and one conducted in 2009, for longitudinal comparison. Respondents were asked a series of questions regarding their knowledge of relationship and marriage education programs in their area, including where they had learned of the classes, what source of advertising they had heard or seen, whether they knew where the classes were held, and whether they had discussed the classes with someone else.
Information was collected to gauge respondents' participation in these courses, including whether they had taken a class in the previous 18 months, how long they attended the courses, whether they had received other services as a result of attending the classes, and whether they had suggested the classes to someone else.
Respondents were also queried on whether they would be interested in attending a relationship class or a parenting class. Additional topics included parental relationships with their children, and relationship quality. Demographic variables include relationship status, household composition, employment status, parental status, race, age, and household income.</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">The purpose of CHMI was to examine the impacts of a community-wide effort aimed at improving relationship skills and increasing healthy marriage.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This poll is part of a continuing series of monthly surveys
that solicit public opinion on the presidency and on a range of other
political and social issues. Respondents were asked to give their
opinions of President George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency,
foreign policy, the situation in the Middle East, and the campaign
against terrorism, as well as their views of Secretary of State Colin
Powell, Pope John Paul II, Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, and Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. A series of questions addressed the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Respondents were asked whether they
sympathized with Israel or the Palestinians, whether Israel should alter
its military presence in the occupied territories, and whether the
United States should publicly support either side. Respondents were
questioned as to whether they believed Colin Powell's trip to the Middle
East would be successful, whether the United States government has a
responsibility to establish peace in the Middle East, and whether they
believed involvement in the conflict would increase the likelihood of
terrorist attacks against America. Those polled were questioned about
the sexual abuse allegations against Catholic priests. Respondents were
asked what they believed to be the greatest problem facing the Catholic
Church, whether the child sex accusations harmed the reputation of the
Catholic Church, whether celibacy increased the likelihood of child sex
abuse, and whether they believed the Pope was aware of the abuse before
the allegations were made public. Lastly, respondents were asked whether
they believed surveillance cameras on city streets reduced crime or
invaded people's privacy, and whether they approved of the placement of
surveillance cameras on sites that are important to the country's
history. Background information on respondents includes age, gender,
race, religion, education, political party, political orientation,
marital status, number of children in the household, and household
income.</abstract>

      <abstract><p>The quality of community life in the Detroit metropolitan
area and factors influencing it were the main focus for this Detroit
Area Study. To gauge perceptions of the quality of life in the Detroit
tri-county area, respondents were asked how satisfied or dissatisfied
they were with the tri-county area in general, with their
neighborhoods, and with the quality of local community services, such
as quality of local roads, public schools, police and garbage
collection. In addition, the survey measured respondents' satisfaction
or dissatisfaction with their own education, income, health, amount of
leisure time, marriage, family life, job, home, and other aspects of
their lives. Respondents also were questioned about their expectations
for the future, their friendships in the tri-county area, friendliness
with neighbors, use of recreational facilities, and where their
children played. The survey also sought respondents' opinions on a wide
range of other issues such as race relations, social stratification,
abortion, the benefits of the free enterprise system, whether or not
the United States was a meritocracy, and the meaning and value of
democracy. Additional information gathered by the survey includes
duration of residence in the tri-county area and at the current
residence, place of previous residence, home ownership, rent payments,
value of the home, number of separate bedrooms, motor vehicle ownership
and use, use of public transportation, employment status, occupation
and industry, independence and authority at work, number of siblings
ever born, religious preference, social class identification, political
preference, and information on age, sex, place of birth, income, race,
ethnicity, and household composition.</p></abstract>

      <abstract><p>Understanding How Personal Networks Change: Wave 1 (UCNets) is the University of California Berkeley Social Networks Study, a longitudinal study with the objective of understanding how network composition changes over time as a result of life course transitions - e.g., graduation, marriage, retirement or widowhood - and how these changes are related to health status and outcomes.  Using mostly addressed-based sampling from six San Francisco Bay Area counties, the study recruited participants in two age groups (cohorts) - 21-30 year-olds and 50-70 year-olds -- to maximize the possibility of experiencing a life transition.  There are 3 waves of interviewing. The first interview, Wave 1, was May 2015 through January 2016. The re-interview
for Wave 2 was conducted in Feb-June 2017, and Wave 3 was during Feb-May 2018. In Wave 1, the majority of respondents completed a face-to-face (FTF) survey, with the rest filling out a comparable web survey. In Wave 2 about half completed the FTF survey, and in Wave 3, about one-quarter. The survey contains items regarding households, personal networks, family milestones, employment, health status and behavior, personality and demographic characteristics.</p></abstract>
      <abstract>n/a</abstract>
      <abstract>Using an address-based sampling (ABS), potential respondents were sent a letter inviting them to participate in the survey. The letter directed them to call a toll-free number or visit a website to take a screener survey to confirm age group, as well as randomize the selection by age group and within age group. Then qualifying respondents were randomly selected such that 3 out of 4 were directed to a face-to-face (FTF) survey and the others to a web survey.</abstract>

      <abstract>Oleoresin capsicum (OC), or pepper spray, has gained wide
 acceptance as standard police equipment in law enforcement as a swift
 and effective method to subdue violent, dangerous suspects in the
 field. As a use-of-force method, however, OC spray has been alleged in
 the media to have been associated with a number of in-custody
 deaths. The goal of this study was to assess the safety of a
 commercially available OC spray in use by law enforcement agencies
 nationwide. The study was conducted as a randomized, cross-over,
 controlled trial on volunteer human subjects recruited from the local
 law enforcement training academy in San Diego County,
 California. Subjects participated in four different experimental
 trials in random order over two separate days in a pulmonary function
 testing laboratory: (a) placebo spray exposure followed by sitting
 position, (b) placebo spray exposure followed by restraint position,
 (c) OC spray exposure followed by sitting position, and (d) OC spray
 exposure followed by restraint position. Prior to participation,
 subjects completed a short questionnaire regarding their health
 status, history of lung disease and asthma, smoking history,
 medication use, and respiratory inhaler medication use. Prior to
 exposure, subjects also underwent a brief screening spirometry in the
 sitting position by means of a portable spirometry device to determine
 baseline pulmonary function. Subjects then placed their heads in a 5'
 x 3' x 3' exposure box that allowed their faces to be exposed to the
 spray. A one-second spray was delivered into the box from the end
 opposite the subject (approximately five feet away). Subjects remained
 in the box for five seconds after the spray was delivered. During this
 time, subjects underwent impedance monitoring to assess whether
 inhalation of the OC or placebo spray had occurred. After this
 exposure period, subjects were placed in either the sitting or prone
 maximal restraint position. Subjects remained in these positions for
 ten minutes. Repeat spirometric measurements were performed, oxygen
 saturation, blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, and pulse
 rate were recorded, and an arterial blood sample was drawn. A total of
 34 subjects completed the study, comprising 128 separate analyzable
 study trials. Variables provided in all three parts of this collection
 include subject's age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass
 index, past medical history, tobacco use history, and history of
 medication use, as well as OC spray or placebo exposure and sitting or
 restraint position during the trial. Part 1 also includes tidal
 volume, respiratory rate, and heart rate at baseline and at 1, 5, 7,
 and 9 minutes, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline
 and at 3, 6, and 9 minutes. Additional variables in Part 2 include
 predicted forced vital capacity and predicted forced expiratory volume
 in 1 second, and the same measures at baseline, 1.5 minutes, and 10
 minutes. Derived variables include percent predicted and mean percent
 predicted values involving the above variables. Part 3 also provides
 end-tidal carbon dioxide and oxygenation levels, oxygen saturation,
 oxygen consumption at baseline and at 1, 5, 7, and 9 minutes, blood
 pH, partial pressure of oxygen, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide
at 8 minutes.</abstract>
      <abstract>Oleoresin capsicum (OC), or pepper spray, has
 gained wide acceptance as standard police equipment in law enforcement
 as a swift and effective method to subdue violent, dangerous suspects
 in the field. Derived from the extract of the capsicum pepper plant,
 OC spray causes inflammation and edema over areas of contact
 (primarily the face, eyes, nose, and mouth), resulting in pain and
 discomfort such that many suspects lose their capacity to resist. With
 widespread use, however, OC spray as a use-of-force method has been
 alleged in the media to have been associated with a number of
 in-custody deaths. Because symptoms of coughing, gagging, and
 shortness of breath are common with OC exposure, concern has focused
 on the respiratory effects of OC spray as playing a potential role in
 these deaths. Moreover, individuals subdued with OC spray in the field
 often require physical restraint, including the prone maximal
 restraint or hobble position. Some have argued that OC in combination
 with restraint can lead to significant respiratory compromise and risk
 for asphyxiation and death. While capsaicin, the active ingredient of
 OC, has been studied extensively in the medical literature for its
 ability to induce coughing, few studies on the physiologic effects of
 OC on humans have been conducted, particularly relating to respiratory
 function. In addition, no prior studies have been done on the effects
 of OC in combination with positional restraint. The goal of this study
 was to assess the safety of a commercially available OC spray in use
 by law enforcement agencies nationwide. Specifically, the researchers
 examined both OC spray and positional restraint in human subjects to
 determine if OC exposure by itself or in combination with positional
 restraint resulted in clinically significant respiratory compromise as
 measured by pulmonary function testing and assessment of oxygenation
 and ventilation. Additionally, they sought to determine if OC spray by
 itself or in combination with positional restraint resulted in any
 hemodynamic compromise as measured by pulse rate and blood pressure,
 whether body size and weight influenced the effects of OC spray in
 regard to respiratory and pulmonary function, and whether pulmonary
 disease (such as asthma), the use of respiratory inhaler medications,
 or history of smoking tobacco influenced the effects of OC spray in
 regard to respiratory and pulmonary function, with both of the latter
 two measured by pulmonary function testing and assessment of
oxygenation and ventilation.</abstract>

 10 minutes. Oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, and
 pulse rate were recorded at 1, 5, and 9 minutes. Blood pressure was
 recorded at 3, 6, and 9 minutes. An arterial blood sample was drawn at
 8 minutes. After the 10-minute period, the subject had a one-hour rest
 and wash-out period to allow for resolution of any residual effects
 from either exposure or position. After this rest period, the subject
 performed a second experiment trial. The subject performed only two
 trials on each experiment day. Though the sequence of trials was
 randomized, no subject received two exposures to OC in a single day.
 A total of 34 subjects completed the study, comprising 128 separate
 analyzable study trials. Eight trials were excluded because the
subjects did not inhale adequately when exposed to OC spray.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This poll, fielded July 7 - 11, 2010, is a part of a continuing series of monthly surveys that solicits public opinion on the presidency and on a range of other political and social issues.  This poll surveyed an oversample of approximately 241 Gulf Coast residents. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way Barack Obama was handling his job as president, the economy, the situations in Afghanistan and Iraq, health care, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the president's duties as commander-in-chief. Respondents were also asked their opinions about the national economy, how much confidence they had in the Republicans and Democrats in Congress to make the right decisions for the country's future, and who they trusted to do a better job, the Democrats or the Republicans, in handling the economy. Multiple questions addressed the oil spill that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. Respondents were asked about their personal feelings about the oil spill, their rating of the federal government, their local and state government, and the oil company, BP's, overall response to the oil spill,  whether the federal government should pursue criminal charges against BP, whether the oil spill was a major environmental disaster, whether the spill affected the economy in their area and their personal finances, and whether respondents were concerned with the long term impacts of the oil spill on the economy, tourism, the environment, and on the safety of seafood that was consumed in the area.
Additional questions asked respondents about their congressional voting preferences, their opinions regarding the federal government, an unemployment benefits extension, the war in Iraq, and the war in Afghanistan.
Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, household income, military service, religious preference, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status, and whether respondents thought of themselves as born again Christians.</abstract>

The Household Internet Use Survey is being conducted by Statistics Canada on behalf of Industry Canada.  The information from this survey will assist the Science and Technology Redesign Project at Statistics Canada to fulfil a three-year contractual agreement between them and the Telecommunications and Policy Branch of Industry Canada. The Household Internet Use Survey is a voluntary survey. It will provide information on the use of computers for communication purposes, and households' access and use of the Internet from home.  The objective of this survey is to measure the demand for telecommunications services by Canadian households. To assess the demand, we measure the frequency and intensity of use of what is commonly referred to as "the information highway" among other things. This was done by asking questions relating to the accessibility of the Internet to Canadian households both at home, the workplace and a number of other locations. The information collected will be used to update and expand upon previous studies done by Statistics Canada on the topic of the Information Highway.

      <abstract>
The two primary objectives of the General Social Survey (GSS) are: to gather data on social trends in order to monitor changes in the living conditions and well being of Canadians over time; and to provide information on specific social policy issues of current or emerging interest. 

This survey collects detailed information on access to and use of technology in Canada.

      <abstract>This Gallup poll seeks the opinions of Canadians, on predominantly political and social issues. The questions ask opinions on the upcoming election, the economic situation, Quebec leadership, and questions related to political party preference. There are also questions on other topics of interest such as the impact of technology that allows for the predetermination of a child's sex before birth, and opinion of pornographic magazines. The respondents were also asked questions so that they could be grouped according to geographic, political and social variables. Topics of interest include: election; pornography; economy; Quebec; and political party preference. Basic demographic variables are also included.</abstract>

      <abstract>
L'Enquête sur la population active (EPA) fournit des estimations de l'emploi et du chômage, lesquelles figurent parmi les mesures les plus actuelles et les plus importantes de la performance de l'économie canadienne. Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.

L'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. 

Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. 

Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.

 sought to examine the violent victimization rate and the factors

      <abstract source="producer">Does the rate of violent victimization differ
 across race and ethnic groups? Researchers of urban social problems
 continue to struggle with this question. The racial and ethnic
 composition of urban America has changed as a result in large part of
 increased immigration over the past 20 years, requiring researchers to
 acknowledge the growth of Latino, Asian, and Afro-Caribbean
 neighborhoods--many of which are in high crime and high poverty
 areas. Despite the growth of studies on race and violence over the
 past two decades that have examined this linkage at the national,
 metropolitan, and city levels, this issue remains largely overlooked
 at the neighborhood level. Many studies of Black or White violence are
 no longer reflections of the nature of racial and ethnic population
 compositions in many urban communities. The contextual factors that
 shape neighborhood-level violence have become important to identify
 since these influences might vary when accounting for racial and
 ethnic differences in violent crime, even within a single city. This
 study examined the violent victimization rate and the factors
 influencing ethnic-specific rates of violence for armed robbery and
 aggravated assault in the city of Miami. The objective was to better
 inform analyses of violent crime by outlining the basic contours of
 race/ethnicity (Latino, African American,and Haitian) in a primarily
immigrant city by focusing on serious reported non-lethal violence.</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">The primary unit of observation for this study was
 the census tract, or more specifically, the 70 census tracts in the
 city of Miami that are comprised of 500 or more residents. Census
 tracts were used as neighborhood proxies because research has shown
 they are the best unit of analysis below the city level to study the
 race and violence connection. The minimum population requirement was
 imposed to help stabilize rates of violence crime and avoid the
 inclusion of small islands in Biscayne Bay with few residents or
 containing upscale high-rise hotels or condominiums. Administrative
 records data were obtained from the United States Bureau of the Census,
 which provided the 1990 census tract data. These data provide detailed
 demographic information such as the number of residents, the
 percentage of tract population living below the poverty level, racial
 and ethnic composition, and a host of other information. The data for
 all reported robberies and aggravated assaults for 1997 was obtained
 from the city of Miami Police Department Research Unit. The address
 for each incident and victim race, surname, age, and gender were
 provided in a raw data file, geocoded into the census tract in which
 they occurred, aggregated to the tract level, and merged with the
census tract information.</abstract>

 aggravated assault and robbery in 1997 are included along with the

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Post-Secondary Education: Cultural, Scholastic and Economic Drivers project was a parental survey conducted by COMPAS Research Inc. for the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation. A national, representative sample of 1,000 parents with at least one child aged 12-17 was interviewed in November 2003. The purpose of the project was to provide the Foundation with a better understanding of how families perceive and prepare for the postsecondary education options of their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this report, COMPAS reports relationships that are valid in a statistically significant sense. Unless the report specifically says that a relationship or difference is nominal or suggestive rather than statistically significant, any observation of a relationship can be assumed to meet the requirements of statistical significance. For example, COMPAS tested each demographic variable against all perceptual questions. Where no significant relationships or patterns were found, results of the correlations are not reported.&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2010 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These "youth experiences" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This file contains demographic data for marriages occurring
in the United States during the 1970 calendar year. The data were
taken from marriage certificates registered with the vital statistics
offices of 42 states and the District of Columbia. The certificates
for each state were chosen at one of five sampling rates (5, 10, 20,
50, or 100 percent), depending on the total number of marriages
performed in the state during the year. Each record includes a weight
factor based on the sampling fraction of the reporting state. The
demographic data collected includes age, race, previous marital
status, number of this marriage, education, and natality of both the
bride and groom. Information about the marriage ceremony itself
includes date, day of the week, and type of ceremony.</abstract>

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Travel Survey of Residents of Canada (TSRC) is a major source of data used to measure the size and status of Canada's tourism industry. It was developed to mesure the volume, the characteristics and the economic impact of domestic travel. Since the beginning of 2005 this survey replaces the Canada Travel Survey (CTS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It measures the size of domestic travel in Canada from the demand side. The objectives of the survey are to provide information about the volume of trips and expenditures for Canadian residents by trip origin, destination, duration, type of accommodation used, trip reason, mode of travel, etc.; to provide information on travel incidence and to provide the socio-demographic profile of travellers and non-travellers. Estimates allow quarterly analysis at the national, provincial and tourism region level (with varying degrees of precision) on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total volume of same-day and overnight trips taken by the residents of Canada with destinations in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;same-day and overnight visits in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;main purpose of the trip/key activities on trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spending on same-day and overnight trips taken in Canada by Canadian residents in total and by category of expenditure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modes of transportation (main/other) used on the trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person-visits, household-visits, spending in total and by expense category for each location visited in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person- and party-nights spent in each location visited in Canada, in total and by type of accommodation used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of travel packages and associated spending and use of motor coach/other guided tours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source of payment (household, government, private employer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demographics of adults that took or did not take trips&lt;/li&gt;

      <abstract source="producer">The purpose of this study is to investigate household-environment dynamics in the Coupled Human and Natural System (CHANS) of Wolong Nature Reserve (WNR), the "flagship" reserve designated for conserving the world-famous endangered Giant Pandas of China. The overall research questions of this study include: (1) how demographic and socioeconomic processes at the household level, e.g. those related to family structures and livelihood systems, affect local residents' resource exploitation patterns and land use practices; (2) how local residents respond to shifts in government policy, especially the implementation of two nationwide conservation programs, the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP), in WNR; and (3) how household and policy dynamics interact to affect the natural environment of WNR. Example hypotheses tested in this study concerned: (1) the effects of conservation policies on local households' energy consumption patterns and fuelwood collection behaviors; (2) the connection between a household's demographic and socioeconomic background and its responses to conservation policies; (3) the relationships between social networks and labor migration; (4) the factors that affect a household's participation in nature-based tourism and the distribution of tourism benefits among different households; and (5) the potential implication of the processes described above on wildlife habitat change and conservation. The data collection in this study focuses on household demographics, household income and expenditure, fuelwood and electricity use, as well as the development of non-agricultural activities such as migration and tourism. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect yearly data of the previous year in 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2010 using highly structured survey questionnaires. A sample of 220 households originally drawn in 1999 was revisited in each year's survey. The definition of households was based on the 2000 population census and family registration records from the local WNR administration.</abstract>

This learning guide investigates crime victimization in the United States. Research questions that can be explored using this learning guide include: what factors affect the likelihood that someone will be victimized, in which demographic groups is victimization the highest, how have victimization rates changed over time, which crimes are more likely to be reported to police, and what are some of the reasons why people do not report crimes to the police. Frequencies, crosstabulations, and comparison of means are used for the analyses.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">The Detention to Community (DTC) study addresses several priority areas of the CJDATS collaborative. First, the study will adapt existing science-based interventions in order to develop specialized services that will address drug abuse, delinquency, and sexual risk-taking among juveniles detained in detention facilities. Second, the study proposes to test an innovative, phasic, multiple-systems intervention in which the in-detention work provides a platform for the adolescent's return to the community. This bridge is created by linking the in-detention and outpatient treatment components in ways that reflect the consensus in the literature regarding the need for integrative, comprehensive interventions for criminal justice involved, substance abusing individuals (Cook, 1992; Altschuler and Armstrong, 1999). The interventions meld public health and public safety concerns, and target members in multiple systems influential to a teen’s developmental outcomes, including the adolescent’s family and school, the judiciary, and treatment providers. Thus, they go beyond the fragmented, sometimes competitive treatment models too often seen in standard criminal justice and drug treatment settings (Belenko, 2000). Third, consistent with recommendations from the literature, NIDA has designated HIV/AIDS prevention in juvenile justice facilities as an urgent public health priority (NIDA, 2002). This
study would test a family-based HIV/AIDS prevention intervention in comparison to standard HIV prevention. Finally, the systems-change possibilities and public policy implications of the proposed study are high, because the study would examine processes and outcomes of implementing the intervention in the real world settings in which the findings are meant to apply -- juvenile detention centers and outpatient community-based drug treatment agencies that work with young offenders (Armstrong and Altschuler, 1998).</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">The fundamental objective of the proposed study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness and
evaluate the relative and net benefit-cost of a cross-context multiple-systems family-based drug
and HIV/STD focused intervention (MDFT-CS) with substance abusing juvenile offenders in
detention and as they transition into the community upon release.</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">The study randomized consenting subjects into two treatment groups.  One group was to receive MDFT-CS (Multidimensional Family Therapy - Cross Systems) and the other was to receive enhanced services as usual (ESAU).  Treatment began in the first week of detention and ended four months after release.  Assessment of subjects took place at five different points: Entry into detention, release from detention, three months after release, six months after release, and nine months after release.  Assessment was conducted in the form of interview by trained assessors.</abstract>

      <abstract>
L’enquête sur les voyages internationaux (EVI) est une enquête permanente que Statistique Canada mène
depuis 1920 pour répondre aux besoins du Système de comptabilité nationale du Canada (Balance des
paiements (BP)). Au fil des ans, le besoin de données sur les caractéristiques détaillées des voyageurs pour
les études de marché et la planification industrielle a été graduellement intégrée à l’enquête. Aujourd’hui,
l’EVI offre une gamme complète de statistiques sur le nombre des voyageurs internationaux, avec
caractéristiques détaillées de leurs voyages comme les dépenses, les activités les lieux visités et la durée du
séjour.
L’EVI couvre à la fois les résidents canadiens qui reviennent de voyages à l’étranger et les visiteurs
internationaux au Canada. L’EVI ne fait pas que répondre aux besoins de la BP : elle est aussi utilisée par le
Compte satellite du tourisme (CST), les Douanes canadiennes, la Commission canadienne du tourisme
(CCT), les organismes provinciaux du tourisme, le Département du Commerce des États-Unis et un certain
nombre d’industries du secteur prié. L’EVI set aussi à faire rapport aux organismes internationaux comme
l’Organisation mondiale du tourisme (OMT) l’Organisation de coopération et de développement économique
(OCDE) et l’Association de tourisme du Pacifique-Asie (ATPA).

      <abstract>This Gallup poll seeks the opinions of Canadians, on predominantly economic, political and social issues. The questions ask opinions on the past election, the state of economy, criminal activity, and immigration and refugees issues. There are also questions on other topics of interest such as the possibility of a merger between the Progressive Conservative Party and The Reform Party, the treatment of criminals by Canadian institutions, the O.J. Simpson trial, and the trial of Paul Bernardo. The respondents were also asked questions so that they could be grouped according to geographic, political and social variables. Topics of interest include: criminal activity; economy; immigration; refugees; conservative political parties merger; and political party preference. Basic demographic variables are also included</abstract>

      <abstract>This study by the Coalition Against Trafficking Women was
 the first to research both contemporary international and domestic
 trafficking of women for sexual exploitation in the United States and
 to include primary research information from interviews with
 trafficked and prostituted women in the sex industry. Telephone and
 personal interviews were conducted with people who had experience with
 or knowledge of sex trafficking in the United States. This data
 collection consists of the verbatim questions and responses from the
 following groups of individuals who were interviewed: (1)
 international and United States women who had been or were in the sex
 industry in the United States, (2) law enforcement officials who had
 experience and expertise in sex-industry related cases or immigration,
 (3) social service workers who provided services to women in
 prostitution or might have come into contact with women from the sex
 industry and those providing services to immigrant populations, and
 (4) health care workers who provided services to women in prostitution
 or who may have come into contact with women in the sex industry. The
 research framework was developed to follow the path of trafficked
 women from their hometown, through their experiences in the sex
 industry, to their present place in life. Information was collected
 on trafficked women's backgrounds, roles and activities while in the
 sex industry, how they were controlled, and how they coped with their
 situations. Respondents were also asked about experiences with
 recruiters, traffickers, pimps, and customers. Additional information
 was gathered on the respondents' views on policies regarding
 trafficking and prostitution, the organization of the sex industry,
 and health and legal aspects of the business. Questionnaires for each
 group of interviewees were constructed according to the topics about
which each group would most likely have knowledge or experience.</abstract>
      <abstract>The aim of this research was to broadly
 investigate the international and domestic trafficking in women in the
 United States. The specific goals were to: (1) document known cases
 and information on sex trafficking in the United States, (2) establish
 a research framework for studying sex trafficking in the United
 States, (3) describe connections between the supply of women
 trafficked from abroad and within the United States and the demand
 created by the sex industries, (4) describe local sex industries and
 their involvement in sex trafficking and prostitution, (5) describe
 linkages between international and domestic trafficking and sex
 industries, (6) describe regional differences in sex trafficking and
 sex industries in the United States, and (7) describe the social
 consequences of sex trafficking in terms of violence, crime, health,
and other human costs.</abstract>
      <abstract>To gather information on sex trafficking and the
 sex industry in the United States as effectively and efficiently as
 possible, target sampling was used, in which individuals with
 knowledge on trafficking and the sex industry were interviewed. The
 goal was to gather information from the most informed experts on the
 topic, not to do a broad survey of knowledge and attitudes. The data
 files in this collection consist of the verbatim questions and
 responses from the following groups of individuals who were
 interviewed: (1) international (Parts 1-16) and United States (Parts
 17-41) women who had been or were in the sex industry in the United
 States, (2) law enforcement officials who had experience and expertise
 in sex-industry related cases or immigration (Parts 42-66), (3) social
 service workers who provided services to women in prostitution or
 might have come into contact with women from the sex industry and
 those providing services to immigrant populations (Parts 67-101), and
 (4) health care workers who provided services to women in prostitution
 or who may have come into contact with women in the sex industry
 (Parts 102-107). A research framework was developed to follow the path
 of trafficked women from their hometown, through their experiences in
 the sex industry, to their present place in life. Interviewees were
 asked about women's backgrounds before being recruited or trafficked
 into the sex industry, about the methods used to recruit them, whether
 and how they were moved around while in the sex industry, how they
 were initiated into the roles and activities they had to carry out,
 how they were controlled while in the sex industry, and how they coped
 with and resisted the conditions under which they lived. Interviewees
 were asked for their recommendations for policies on trafficking and
 prostitution. Since the women interviewed most likely had daily
 contact with other women in prostitution, they were asked for their
 observations and knowledge about other women (possibly trafficked
 women) in the sex industry. Women were asked about their experiences
 with recruiters, traffickers, and pimps and the men who buy them in
 the sex industry. They were asked about their health and well-being
 while in the sex industry and after getting out. Interviewees were
 also asked about the operation of the sex industry in their city or
 region. They were asked about who the traffickers were, how they
 operated, and how the sex industry was organized in that area. The
 questionnaire used in this study was constructed and organized by
 topics related to the path trafficked women might follow and the
 operation of the sex industry in which they were
 exploited. Questionnaires for each group of interviewees were
 constructed according to the topics about which each group would most
 likely have knowledge or experience. The questionnaires were composed
of open- and closed-ended questions on each topic.</abstract>

The classroom based intervention was delivered through a six session curriculum that emphasized the consquences for perpetrators of domestic violence and harassment, state laws and penalties for domestic violence and harassment, the construction of gender roles, and healthy relationships. The school-wide intervention included the development and use of temporary school-based restraining orders, higher levels of faculty and security presence in areas identified by students and school personnel as unsafe "hot spots", and the use of posters to increase awareness and reporting of domestic violence and harassment to school personnel. Pencil and paper surveys were distributed to students at three different times: (1) immediately before the assignment to one of the four study conditions, (2) immediately after the treatment (or control condition) was completed, and (3) between five and six months after assignment to one of the four study conditions.

      <abstract source="producer">This study investigated the accuracy of self-reported drug
 use in three ways. First, the researchers examined differences in the
 accuracy of self-reported drug use across five factors: gender, race,
 age, type of drug, and offense seriousness. Second, an attempt was
 made to determine the specific sources of inaccurate self-reports in
 terms of differences in underreporting and overreporting. Third, the
 researchers sought to explain differences in underreporting and
 overreporting in terms of true differences or differences in
 opportunity to underreport or overreport. This study used data
 collected in 1994 as part of the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) Program
 [DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24 CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, 1987-1997
 (ICPSR 9477)]. The DUF drug testing and measurement methodology
 allows the accuracy of self-reported drug use to be checked with a
 biological criterion, namely urine tests. The sample for this study
 consisted of 4,752 white and Black adults from Indianapolis,
 Ft. Lauderdale, Phoenix, and Dallas. The five exogenous measures
 included in this study were type of drug (marijuana vs.
 crack/cocaine), age (18 through 30 vs. 31 or over), offense
 seriousness (misdemeanor vs. felony), race (Black vs. white), and
 gender (male vs. female). The endogenous measures were accuracy
 (self-report and drug test both positive or both negative
 vs. otherwise), underreporting (self-report negative but drug test
 positive vs. otherwise), and overreporting (self-report positive but
 drug test negative vs. otherwise). Variables include result of
 marijuana urine test, result of cocaine/crack urine test, marijuana
 self-report, cocaine/crack self-report, age group, sex, race, offense
category, and ethnic/gender group.</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">Practitioners, researchers, and policymakers all
 rely extensively on measures of self-reported drug use to determine
 which drug prevention and rehabilitation services should be offered to
 whom, which services are successful, and which services should be
 expanded and continually funded. A well-known problem with
 self-reports is the uncertainty about their ability to accurately
 indicate what is being measured, especially when the topic is as
 sensitive as drug use. In particular, the extent to which
 self-reported drug use is a valid indicator of actual drug use across
 social groups has been repeatedly questioned. While patterns across
 previous studies suggest that validity differences in self-reported
 drug use do exist, these differences could not be statistically
 evaluated because of the diversity in the types of high-risk
 populations studied, the types of drug use measured, and the
 measurement procedures and conditions of each study. This study
 investigated the accuracy of self-reported drug use in three
 ways. First, the researchers examined differences in the accuracy of
 self-reported drug use across five factors: gender, race, age, type of
 drug, and offense seriousness. Second, an attempt was made to
 determine the specific sources of inaccurate self-reports in terms of
 differences in underreporting and overreporting. Third, the
 researchers sought to explain differences in underreporting and
 overreporting in terms of true differences or differences in
 opportunity. Only individuals who tested positive had the opportunity
 to underreport drug use. Similarly, only individuals who tested
negative had the opportunity to overreport drug use.</abstract>

 interviews arrestees on their lifestyle and drug use and collects

 differences in the accuracy of self-reported drug use and the
 differences in underreporting and overreporting of drug use were
 hierarchical loglinear, logit, and logistic regression models. The
 sources of differences in the underreporting and overreporting of drug

      <abstract source="producer"><p source="producer"><hi source="producer">Overview</hi></p>
<p source="producer">The Florida Department of Health and the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS) collaborated with a hospital network composed of nine clinical facilities, to capture electronic medical records (EMR) data of patients who were diagnosed with or treated for invasive breast cancer from 2007 to 2010. Certain hospital data elements were available throughout 2006. An additional year of 2011 follow-up data was also available for a subset of patients receiving medication treatment. The purpose of the data capture was to advance patient-centered outcomes research to reduce the morbidity and mortality of cancer and other comorbidities.</p>
<p source="producer">A breast cancer pilot study was also conducted from a subset of all transmitted EMR records, consisting of admission records with a principal and/or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis between 174.0 and 174.9.  The subset dataset was then linked to the central cancer registry using patient social security number, first and last name, and date of birth.  Using a deterministic matching algorithm a total of 11,506 unique patients were matched to a patient in the FCDS database, resulting in 12,804 primary tumors and 53,940 unique hospital admission records.  While the hospital EMR defined the patient dataset, all registry records for that patient were included in the final breast cancer pilot database, regardless of the reporting hospital or the date of diagnosis.  This was to ensure capture of the entire diagnostic and treatment profile for each breast cancer patient.</p>
<p source="producer"><hi source="producer">Data Access</hi></p>
<p source="producer">These data are not available from ICPSR.  The data contain confidential information that can directly identify a patient.  There are also reporting facility data. Therefore, to obtain these data, researchers will need to follow the Florida Cancer Data System data-sharing agreement process, as outlined on the FCDS data sharing request <ExtLink URI="http://fcds.med.miami.edu/inc/datarequest.shtml" source="producer"/>.</p></abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">n/a</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer"><p source="producer">Data collected for this project came from multiple sources, including: Florida Department of Health, Office of Vital Statistics (DOH), the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS), the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), and a Florida hospital network composed of nine clinical facilities. Florida DOH and FCDS began receiving these hospital records and processing/linking them with other administrative databases between December 2011 and August, 2012.  Under the guidance of Florida DOH, the Florida Cancer Data System is the organizational producer of this pilot study dataset.</p>
<p source="producer">The study tables created for this project contain data for 11,506 unique breast cancer patients who were diagnosed and/or treated between 2007-2011 at a partnering Florida hospital.  Patient hospital EMRs were linked with Florida cancer registry data.  Other administrative databases were linked for updated hospital admissions/discharge records and mortality information from across the state.</p>
<p source="producer">The study database consists of hospital records for patient clinical characteristics, health histories, comorbid conditions for which specific treatment modalities are provided, including chemotherapy and radiation, medications orders, as well as the treatment doses administered on specific dates and times.  These hospital data also contain clinicians' notes during hospitalizations and at the time of discharge, pathology reports were generated for patient laboratory tests performed.  Financial charges for services provided to patients were collected from the hospital billing department.</p>
<p source="producer">Other state administrative records merged for these study tables include routinely collected data from the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS), hospital discharge data and ambulatory records maintained by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), and mortality data collected by the Florida Department of Health, Office of Vital Statistics.</p>
<p source="producer">Pilot study data tables contain discrete and text data which include raw numeric values from hospital medical records, and include clinical notations retained in patient pathology reports and discharge summaries.  A subset of all transmitted EMR records were created consisting of admission (event) records with a principal and/or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis between 174.0 and 174.9.  The subset dataset was then linked to the central cancer registry using patient social security number, first and last name, and date of birth.  Hospital discharge data and ambulatory surgical data were collected as routinely collected administrative data. Patient's death information was collected from state death certificate data. United States Census data were used to categorize patient socioeconomic strata.</p></abstract>

This public use microdata file contains non-aggregated data for a wide variety of variables collected from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS collects monthly information on the labour market activities of Canada's working age population. This product is for users who prefer to do their own analysis by focusing on specific subgroups in the population or by cross-classifying variables that are not in our catalogued products.

This file contains both personal characteristics for all individuals in the household and detailed labour force characteristics for household members 15 years of age and over. The personal characteristics include age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Detailed labour force characteristics include employment information such as class of worker, usual and actual hours of work, employee hourly and weekly wages, industry and occupation of current or most recent job, public and private sector, union status, paid or unpaid overtime hours, job permanency, hours of work lost, job tenure, and unemployment information such as duration of unemployment, methods of job search and type of job sought. Labour force characteristics are also available for students during the school year and during the summer months as well as school attendance whether full or part-time and the type of institution. These and more are available by province and for the three largest census metropolitan areas (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver).

This is a monthly file, and is available going back to 1976.

LFS revisions: LFS estimates have been adjusted to reflect population counts based on the 2011 Census and includes updates to 2011 Geography classification system and were revised back to 2001.

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;L'Enquête sur la population active (EPA) fournit des estimations de l'emploi et du chômage, lesquelles figurent parmi les mesures les plus actuelles et les plus importantes de la performance de l'économie canadienne. Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. Pour une liste complète et une description des variables de l'EPA, veuillez consulter le Guide de l'Enquête sur la population active, disponible sous la section Questionnaire(s) et guide(s) de déclaration ci-dessus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract source="producer">This data collection is one in a series of financial
 surveys of consumers conducted annually since 1946. In a nationally
 representative sample, the head of each spending unit (usually the
 husband, the main earner, or the owner of the home) was interviewed.
 The basic unit of reference in the study was the spending unit, but
 some family data are also available. The questions in the 1958 survey
 covered the respondent's attitudes toward national economic conditions
 and price activity, as well as the respondent's own financial situation.
 Other questions examined the spending unit head's occupation, and the
 nature and amount of the spending unit's income, debts, liquid assets,
 changes in liquid assets, savings, investment preferences, and actual
 and expected purchases of cars and other major durables. The survey
 also elicited respondent's attitudes about different methods of using
 income remaining after expenses were met, e.g., investing in stocks or
 putting money in savings. In addition, the survey explored in detail
 the subject of housing, e.g., previous and present home ownership,
 value of respondent's dwelling, and mortgage information.  Respondents
 also were asked for the details of the head's employment (e.g., full-
 or part-time and number of weeks in the year employed) and
 unemployment status. Personal data include number of people in the
 spending unit, age, sex, and education of the head, and the race and
sex of the respondent.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This special topic poll, conducted January 13-15, 1997, is
 part of a continuing series of monthly polls that solicit public
 opinion on the presidency and on a range of other political and social
 issues. This data collection was undertaken to assess public opinion
 prior to President Bill Clinton's second-term inauguration as
 president of the United States. Respondents were asked to give their
 opinions of President Clinton and his handling of the first term of
 his presidency, whether he would do a better or worse job in his
 second term in office, whether they approved of his choices for
 Cabinet and other top positions in his administration, and what the
 nature of his relationship with Congress should be in his second
 term. Views were sought on whether President Clinton had made progress
 toward reducing unemployment and improving education during his first
 term, and whether he would make substantial progress in these areas
 during his second term. Respondents rated the most important issue
 facing the country, whether they were better or worse off financially
 compared to four years ago, whether they approved of the way Congress
 was handling its job, whether they expected Congress to do a better
 job in the next two years, and whether they trusted the Clinton
 administration or the Republicans in Congress to handle the main
 problems the nation would face over the next few years. Other
 questions asked whether respondents approved of the way Hillary
 Clinton was handling her job as first lady and the amount of influence
 she held over her husband, and whether she should play a greater role
 in her husband's second administration. A series of questions asked
 about recent allegations involving President Clinton, including
 Whitewater, the Democratic National Campaign Committee's acceptance of
 foreign contributions, and former Arkansas state employee Paula
 Jones's sexual harassment charges, and whether they would interfere
 with his ability to serve as president. Additional topics addressed
 what actions the government should take to protect the long-term
 financial stability of Social Security and the Medicare health system
 and the overall level of ethics and honesty in politics and the
 federal government. Demographic variables include sex, age, race,
 education level, household income, political party affiliation,
political philosophy, and voter participation history.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">The Survey of Consumer Attitudes and Behavior series (also known as the Surveys of Consumers) was undertaken to measure changes in consumer attitudes and expectations, to understand why such changes occur, and to evaluate how they relate to consumer decisions to save, borrow, or make discretionary purchases. The data regularly include the Index of Consumer Sentiment, the Index of Current Economic Conditions, and the Index of Consumer Expectations. Since the 1940s, these surveys have been produced quarterly through 1977 and monthly thereafter.
The surveys conducted in 2012 focused on topics such as evaluations and expectations about personal finances, employment, price changes, and the national business situation. Opinions were collected regarding respondents' appraisals of present market conditions for purchasing houses, automobiles, computers, and other durables. Also explored in this survey, were respondents' types of savings and financial investments, loan use, family income, and retirement planning. The March 2012 survey included a section focusing on credit insurance and credit protection.
Other topics in this series typically include ownership, lease, and use of automobiles, respondents' use of personal computers at home and in the office, and respondents' familiarity with and use of the Internet. Demographic information includes ethnic origin, sex, age, marital status, and education.</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">The purpose of this survey series is to forecast changes in aggregate consumer behavior.</abstract>

Ce fichier de microdonnées à grande diffusion renferme des données non agrégées associées à une vaste gamme de variables recueillies dans le cadre de l'Enquête sur la population active (EPA). L'EPA recueille des renseignements mensuels sur l'activité de la population canadienne en âge de travailler. Ce produit est destiné aux utilisateurs qui préfèrent réaliser leur propre analyse et qui s'intéressent à des sous-groupes particuliers de la population ou qui désirent effectuer des recoupements de variables ne faisant pas partie de nos produits catalogués.

Le fichier renferme les caractéristiques personnelles de tous les membres du ménage et les caractéristiques détaillées de l'activité de tous les membres du ménage âgés de 15 ans et plus. Parmi les caractéristiques personnelles figurent l'âge, le sexe, l'état matrimonial, le niveau d'instruction et les caractéristiques de la famille. Les caractéristiques détaillées de l'activité comprennent des renseignements sur l'emploi, comme la catégorie de travailleurs, les heures habituellement et effectivement travaillées, le salaire horaire et hebdomadaire de l'employé, la branche d'activité associée à l'emploi actuel ou au dernier emploi, le secteur public ou privé, la couverture syndicale, les heures supplémentaires rémunérées et non rémunérées, la permanence de l'emploi, les heures de travail perdues, la durée de l'emploi, de même que les renseignements sur le chômage, comme la durée du chômage, les méthodes de recherche d'emploi et le genre de travail recherché. Les données sur les caractéristiques de l'activité des étudiants pendant l'année scolaire et pendant la période estivale, sur la fréquentation scolaire à temps plein ou à temps partiel ainsi que sur le type d'établissement sont également disponibles. Ces données et d'autres renseignements sont disponibles selon la province et pour les trois principales régions métropolitaines de recensement (Montréal, Toronto et Vancouver).

Il s'agit d'un fichier mensuel, et les données disponibles remontent à 1976.

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Travel Survey of Residents of Canada (TSRC) is a major source of data used to measure the size and status of Canada's tourism industry. It was developed to mesure the volume, the characteristics and the economic impact of domestic travel. Since the beginning of 2005 this survey replaces the Canada Travel Survey (CTS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It measures the size of domestic travel in Canada from the demand side. The objectives of the survey are to provide information about the volume of trips and expenditures for Canadian residents by trip origin, destination, duration, type of accommodation used, trip reason, mode of travel, etc.; to provide information on travel incidence and to provide the socio-demographic profile of travellers and non-travellers. Estimates allow quarterly analysis at the national, provincial and tourism region level (with varying degrees of precision) on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total volume of same-day and overnight trips taken by the residents of Canada with destinations in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;same-day and overnight visits in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;main purpose of the trip/key activities on trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spending on same-day and overnight trips taken in Canada by Canadian residents in total and by category of expenditure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modes of transportation (main/other) used on the trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person-visits, household-visits, spending in total and by expense category for each location visited in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person- and party-nights spent in each location visited in Canada, in total and by type of accommodation used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of travel packages and associated spending and use of motor coach/other guided tours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source of payment (household, government, private employer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demographics of adults that took or did not take trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;travel party composition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three files for this survey - Trip File, Visit File, and Person File.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TSRC is an independant supplemnet to the Labour Force Survey (LFS).&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract><p>The AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) Data Report (ADR) includes two components: the Grantee Report and the Client Report. All ADAPs are required to submit both reports.</p>
<p>The Grantee Report is a collection of basic information about the grantee characteristics and policies. It includes a Programmatic Summary section and an Annual Submission section.</p>
<p>The Client Report (or client-level data) is a collection of one record for each client enrolled in the ADAP. Each record includes the client's encrypted unique identifier, basic demographic data, and enrollment and certification information. A client's record may also include data about the ADAP-funded insurance and
medication received, including the costs of these services, as well as HIV clinical information.</p></abstract>
      <abstract><p>The HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) currently requires that all ADAPs report aggregate data quarterly using the ADAP Quarterly Report (AQR). However, aggregate data limits HAB's ability to respond to inquiries from Congress and other stakeholders regarding the ADAP program. To address this limitation, HAB has developed a new data reporting system, the ADAP Data Report (ADR). The ADR will enable HAB to
evaluate the impact of the ADAP program on a national level. The ADR will allow HAB to characterize the individuals using the program, describe the ADAP-funded services being used, and delineate the costs associated with these services.</p>
<p>ADAPs will begin collecting data for the ADR in October 2012. However, because the ADR is new, grantees will continue to submit the AQR until they become accustomed to the ADR and the quality of the information provided through the ADR accurately represents the program. At that time, the AQR will be retired.</p>
<p>HAB's goal is to have a client-level data reporting system that provides data on the characteristics of the
ADAPs and the clients served with program funds. The ADAP client-level data submitted will be used to:</p>
<p>- Monitor the clinical outcomes of clients receiving care and treatment through ADAP;</p>
<p>- Monitor the use of ADAP funds for appropriately addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States;</p>
<p>- Monitor the support provided by ADAP to the most vulnerable, especially minority communities;</p>
<p>- Address the needs and concerns of Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) concerning the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the RWHAP; and</p>
<p>- Monitor the outcomes achieved in response to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.</p></abstract>

      <abstract>
The Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating 2010 is the latest iteration of a series of surveys that began with the National Survey of Giving, Volunteering and participating. It was conducted by Statistics Canada in 1997 as a supplement to the Labour Force Survey, and was repeated in the fall of 2000. In 2001, the federal government provided funding to establish a permanent survey program on charitable giving, volunteering and participating within Statistics Canada. The survey itself was renamed the Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating (CSGVP). The CSGVP was developed through a partnership of federal government departments and voluntary sector organizations. These include Canadian Heritage, Health Canada, Human Resources and Social Development Canada, Imagine Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Statistics Canada and Volunteer Canada. There are two data files for the 2010 Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating (CSGVP): the main answer file (MAIN.TXT), and the giving file (GS.TXT). For most questions in the CSGVP questionnaire, the reference period was the 12 months preceding the interview. For the provincial component, interviews were conducted from September 14th to December 10th, 2010. The territorial or northern component interviews took place during same time period as the provincial component.

      <abstract><p>This data collection is comprised of responses from two sets of survey questionnaires, the basic Current Population Survey (CPS) and a survey administered as a supplement to the November 2003 questionnaire on the topic of tobacco use in the United States. The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also administered in February 2003 (ICPSR 4526) and June 2003 (ICPSR 4527). These three supplements comprise the 2003 wave of TUS data.</p><p>The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.</p><p>The TUS, like most CPS supplements, was designed to be a proxy response supplement, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members, provided the respondent was a household member 15 years of age or older. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent supplement questions. All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS core items were eligible for the November 2003 supplement items.</p><p>The TUS consisted of items PEA1 through PEK5. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for certain items. Information was collected from proxies on topics such as smoking status (items PEA1-PEA3) and the use of other tobacco-related products, such as pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PEJ1a-PEJ2a).</p><p>In addition to these smoking status and other tobacco use questions, self-respondents were queried on the following topics depending on their smoking/tobacco use status (i.e., every day, some days, or former cigarette smokers and/or users of other non-cigarette tobacco products):</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<itm><p>Smoking history</p></itm>
<itm><p>Current cigarette smoking prevalence and consumption</p></itm>
<itm><p>Type of cigarettes smoked</p></itm>
<itm><p>Price of last pack/carton of cigarettes purchased and state where purchased</p></itm>
<itm><p>Medical and dental advice to quit smoking</p></itm>
<itm><p>Attempts and intentions to quit smoking cigarettes and/or other forms of tobacco use</p></itm>
<itm><p>Workplace smoking policies and smoking rules in the home</p></itm>
<itm><p>Attitudes toward smoking in public places</p></itm></list><p>Another generally unique feature to the 2003 TUS-CPS was the administration of questions to former smokers on their previous level of addiction, products/resources/methods used to quit smoking, and advice from health
professionals. This feature enables comparisons between characteristics of former smokers (or successful quitters) and current smokers attempting to quit.</p><p>Administrative information was collected on who the proxy
respondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected include age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.</p></abstract>

      <abstract>This administrative dataset provides descriptive information about the families and children served through the federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF). CCDF dollars are provided to states, territories, and tribes to provide assistance to low-income families receiving or in transition from temporary public assistance, to obtain quality child care so they can work, or depending on their state's policy, to attend training or receive education. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 requires states and territories to collect information on all family units receiving assistance through the CCDF and to submit monthly case-level data to the Office of Child Care. States are permitted to report case-level data for the entire population, or a sample of the population, under approved sampling guidelines.The Summary Records file contains monthly state-level summary information including the number of families served. The Family Records file contains family-level data including single parent status of the head of household, monthly co-payment amount, date on which child care assistance began, reasons for care (e.g., employment, training/education, protective services, etc.), income used to determine eligibility, source of income, and the family size on which eligibility is based. The Child Records file contains child-level data including ethnicity, race, gender, and date of birth. The Setting Records file contains information about the type of child care setting, the total amount paid to the provider, and the total number of hours of care received by the child. The Pooling Factor file provides state-level data on the percentage of child care funds that is provided through the CCDF, the federal Head Start region the grantee (state) is in and is monitored by, and the state FIPS code for the grantee.</abstract>

<p>The study includes data collected with the purpose of creating an integrated dataset that would allow researchers to address significant, policy-relevant gaps in the literature--those that are best answered with cross-jurisdictional data representing a wide array of economic and social factors. The research addressed five research questions:</p>
<list type="ordered">
<itm>What is the impact of gentrification and suburban diversification on crime within and across jurisdictional boundaries?</itm>
<itm>How does crime cluster along and around transportation networks and hubs in relation to other characteristics of the social and physical environment?</itm>
<itm>What is the distribution of criminal justice-supervised populations in relation to services they must access to fulfill their conditions of supervision?</itm>
<itm>What are the relationships among offenders, victims, and crimes across jurisdictional boundaries?</itm>
<itm>What is the increased predictive power of simulation models that employ cross-jurisdictional data?</itm>
</list></abstract>
      <abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine whether collection and integration of data cross jurisdictional boundaries and agencies can inform decision making affecting public safety.</abstract>
      <abstract>This study includes a collection of crime incident data, arrest data, and supervised offender data. Sources of information came from the police departments of Washington, DC, Montgomery County, and Prince George County. In addition to the criminal justice data, the study includes a wide range of economic, land use, and transit data collected from the National Establishment Time Series (NETS), the 2012 American Community survey, the website Walkscore.com, and data from the DC Office of the Chief Technology Officer Geographic Information System Catalog for 2014. Researchers also collected transit data from the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority (WMATA) for 2008 to 2013 and the WMATA bike census which took place in 2006-07, 2011, 2012, and 2013.</abstract>
      <abstract><p>The collection includes six SPSS datasets:</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<itm>BikeTheft_Data.sav contains 18 variables and 86 cases (bike thefts by DC metro stations)</itm>
<itm>CrimeatMetro_data.sav contains 57 variables and 87 cases (crime near DC metro stations)</itm>
<itm>CSOSA_data.sav contains 21 variables and 20,318 cases (individuals under community supervision in Maryland)</itm>
<itm>GDT_data.sav contains 6 variables and 39,066 cases (location and time of gun shots in DC)</itm>

      <abstract>This repository contains the data generated by Lemelin et al. (2019)* regarding the analysis of the topographic roughness of the Moon &#13;
using the Wavelet Leaders Method and the Lunar Digital Elevation Model from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter and SELENE Terrain Camera. &#13;
Near global mosaics (+/- 60 degrees in latitude) of the Holder exponent values and the correlation coefficient can be found for the three scaling regimes analysed.&#13;
Local mosaics of the Holder exponent values for the smallest scaling regime, and for the intermediate scaling regime (in some cases) can be found&#13;
for the seven regions of interest analysed at a higher spatial resolution than the global product. The definition of the scaling regimes can be found in Lemelin et al. (2019).&#13;
These data products are stored as geotiffs using the GCS_Moon_2000 (datum D_Moon_2000) coordinate system. The data used to generate figures 7 and 8 in&#13;
Lemelin et al. (2019) can also be found here as an excel table.&#13;

      <abstract>This Gallup poll looks to collect the opinions and ideas of Canadians on subjects of interest and importance to the country. Some of these important topics concern unions, strikes, defence policy and old age pensions. There are also several variables that deal with religious and moral questions like the afterlife and capital punishment. Respondents were also asked questions so that they could be grouped according to geographic, demographic, and social variables. Topics of interest include: advertisements; the afterlife; big business influencing laws; Canadian Pension Plan (CPP) benefits; capital punishment abolishment; church attendance; defence policy; Diefenbaker's performance as Prime Minister; family issues; the Federal election; the frequency of the respondents reading the Bible; labour influencing laws; magazine advertisements; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); newspaper advertisements; whether CPP payments should be paid to ex-patriots; radio commercials; railroad workers pay raises; the truthfulness of radio commercials; union membership; and voting behaviour. Basic demographics variables are also included.</abstract>

      <abstract>The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as "personal" or "property." Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A "household respondent" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS, referred to as the collection year, contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This study assessed the influence of the criminal justice
system on the bereavement process of individuals who have lost loved
ones to homicide. The primary question motivating this research was:
Can the criminal justice system help to heal the harm of the
bereaved's loss? The three main goals of this study were to examine:
(1) bereaveds' perceptions of and experiences with the criminal
justice system and its professionals, (2) the ways criminal justice
professionals perceive and manage the bereaved, and (3) the nature of
the association between the criminal justice system and bereaveds'
psychological well-being. Data were obtained from in-depth interviews
conducted in June through December 2000 with two different groups of
people. The first group represented individuals who had lost loved
ones to murder between 1994 and 1998 in one county in Texas (Parts
1-33). The second group (Parts 34-55) was comprised county criminal
justice professionals (murder detectives, prosecutors, criminal court
judges, victim's service counselors, and victim's rights advocates).
For Parts 1-33, interviewees were asked a series of open-ended
questions about the criminal justice system, including how they
learned about the death and the current disposition of the murder
case. They also were asked what they would change about the criminal
justice system's treatment of them. The bereaved were further asked
about their sex, age, race, education, marital status, employment
status, income, and number of children. Additional questions were
asked regarding the deceased's age at the time of the murder, race,
relationship to interviewee, and the deceased's relationship to the
murderer, if known. For Parts 34-55, respondents were asked about
their job titles, years in those positions, number of murder cases
handled in the past year, number of murder cases handled over the
course of their career, and whether they thought the criminal justice
system could help to heal the harm of people who had lost loved ones
to murder. All interviews (Parts 1-55) were tape-recorded and later
transcribed by the interviewer, who replaced actual names of
individuals, neighborhoods, cities, counties, or any other
identifiable names with pseudonyms.</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">Researchers consistently have found that those
 bereaved as a result of a homicidal event experience psychological
 difficulties, traumatic imaginings of the death, and frustrations with
 the criminal justice system. General sociological research on the
 criminal justice system has shown that criminal justice professionals
 play a key role in system outcomes and individual
 experiences. However, the specific effects of the criminal justice
 system on the bereavement process of people who have lost loved ones
 to murder has never been fully researched. This study sought to assess
 the influence of the criminal justice system on bereavement as a
 result of homicide. The primary question motivating this research was:

 bereaved's loss? The three main goals of this study were to examine:

 Names and contact information for the bereaved interviews were
 obtained from: (1) death certificate records furnished by the Texas
 Department of Health, (2) local newspaper articles, and (3)
 victim/witness counselors with the county District Attorney's
 Office. Individuals were asked to participate in the study via letters
 or telephone calls. The interviews allowed interviewees to talk about
 their experiences in their own words. Each interview lasted, on
 average, two-and-a-half hours. When the interview continued for more
 than two hours, the interviewer scheduled a second meeting. Those
 interviewees living out of state were interviewed via the telephone,
 while in-person interviews took place at the bereaved respondent's
 place of residence, local restaurants, or in the office of the
 interviewer. There was one non-English speaking bereaved, whose
 interview was conducted with the help of a Spanish-English interpreter
 who also transcribed the interview. For Parts 34-55, interviews were
 conducted with county criminal justice professionals. These interviews
 took approximately an hour to complete and took place in the
 professional's office, place of residence, or at local restaurants.
 All interviews (Parts 1-55) were tape-recorded and later transcribed
 by the interviewer, who replaced actual names of individuals,
 neighborhoods, cities, counties, or any other identifiable names with

L'objet de l'enquête sur les finances des consommateurs est de rassembler des données afin d'évaluer la répartition du revenu des familles et des particuliers selon sa taille. Cette enquête, ainsi que l'enquête 3502 permettent de recueillir des données en vue d'un programme d'estimations annuelles. Il y a toujours un module de données sur un sujet particulier. Par exemple, dans l'EFC de 1984, des renseignements sur le logement, l'avoir, les dettes, les intérêts professionnels. Il a participation à un régime de pensions ont été recueillies. Ce questionnaire constituait la partie variable de l'enquête en 1984; dans d'autres cycles d'enquête, des sujets particuliers tels que l'utilisation des services de santé et des services éducatifs (1975), l'avoir et la dette (1977), les changements dans la composition de la famille durant l'année de référence (1979) et les bénéficiaires de prestations d'assurance chômage (1981) ont fait l'objet du questionnaire spécial. Exception faite du module concernant l'avoir et la dette, qui a été repris tous les cinq ou sept ans, il s'agit de sujets qui font l'objet de recherches spéciales ponctuelles.

      <abstract>Annual Demographic Statistics contains the following data: population estimates by age and sex for Canada, the provinces, territories, census divisions and census metropolitan areas; estimates by age, sex and marital status for the provinces and territories; and estimates of the number of census families for Canada, the provinces and territories, by type of family (husband-wife, lone-parent), size of family, age of children and age and sex of parents. It also includes statistics for the demographic components that were used to produce the population estimates (births, deaths, marriages, divorces, immigration, total emigration, internal migrations and non permanent residents) by age and sex. In addition, there are highlights of current demographic trends and a description of the methodology; population data from 1971 for provinces and territories, and from 1986 for census divisions and census metropolitan areas; and animated age pyramids, which illustrate the aging of the population.</abstract>

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Internet Use Survey (CIUS) was conducted for the first time in 2005, replacing the Household Internet Use Survey (HIUS). The HIUS had been conducted on a biennial basis from 1997 to 2003 to measure household Internet use. As growth in the number of households using the Internet leveled off, the survey was redesigned to focus on how individuals, rather than households, are using the Internet. The individual-level CIUS was conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2009.&lt;p/&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;For 2010, the CIUS was redesigned to meet the measurement needs of the Broadband Canada: Connecting Rural Canadians Program, sponsored by Industry Canada. For the first time, the redesigned survey incorporated a hybrid design, consisting of both a Household Component and an Individual Component. &lt;p/&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The 2012 CIUS was conducted under the 2010 design. &lt;p/&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The Household Component includes a short series of questions on the type of Internet connections and devices used by household members, from home, as well as availability of high speed service, and a standard module on household income. The questions may be answered by any knowledgeable member of the household. &lt;p/&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Following the Household Component, an individual aged 16 years and older was randomly selected to complete the Individual Component. Respondents were asked about their use of the Internet, and online activities including electronic commerce. While the Household Component covered Internet access at home, the Individual Component covers use of the Internet from any location. &lt;p/&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The Individual Component begins with a module on Current User (CU) of the Internet. As in past years, the CIUS asks individuals about their locations of Internet use, frequency and intensity of use, and reasons for non-use. 
The Specific Use (SU) module, as in 2010, asks respondents to report their Internet activities. These activities cover a wide range of topics including the use of email, instant messaging, formal education, and the search for employment. As with the 2010 survey, these activities could have taken place from any location and using any device. &lt;p/&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The Electronic Commerce (EC) module collects information on the total number, the total cost, and the types of goods and services ordered over the internet. Additional information is also collected on the location of delivery, the means of payment, and the main reason for not participating in e-commerce. This module remained consistent with the 2010 survey. &lt;p/&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The Privacy and Security (PS) module includes questions about online behaviour (e.g., use of security software, frequency of backing up files) and experiences related to security (e.g., experienced a computer virus). For the 2012 survey, this module was slightly modified with the addition of questions regarding concern for security while using internet banking or credit cards online. &lt;p/&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;As the 2010 and the 2012 surveys have two distinct components - household and individual - with revised and streamlined questions, it is not appropriate to make direct comparisons with results from previous years. Data users who have questions about the survey are invited to contact the Investment, Science and Technology Division (please refer to Chapter 1.0 for contact information). &lt;p/&gt;

      <abstract>The Transitional Aid Research Project (TARP) was a
randomized field experiment conducted in Texas and Georgia in
1976-1977 that was designed to reduce recidivism among ex-prisoners by
lowering incentives for re-engaging in property crime through
provision of minimal levels of income support and extension of some
unemployment insurance coverage to released prisoners. This study
evolved out of an earlier LIFE (Living Insurance for Ex-Prisoners)
study conducted in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1970s. In the LIFE
study, 500 prisoners with a high probability of re-arrest were
randomly assigned at release from prison to experimental and control
groups which varied by the amount of money received (contingent upon
employment or unemployment and job placement services provided). The
results showed that ex-prisoners receiving payments were less likely
to be re-arrested for property theft-related crimes than those who
received only job placement or no services or payments of any
kind. The United States Department of Labor commissioned the TARP
experiment, designed to replicate the LIFE experiment while providing
a larger and more representative sample of prisoners, greater
variation in treatment conditions, and administration of payments and job
placement services through existing agencies rather than by a special
purpose project staff. Texas and Georgia were the states chosen for
the experiment, and stratified random samples of inmates were
assigned, at the time of release from prison, to experimental and
control groups. The groups varied in the amount of money and job
placement services they received upon their release. Originally, the
data were recorded in nine files for each state corresponding to each
of the nine different sources of information for each TARP case. The
ICPSR data collection combines these into one file for each state:
Part 1 for Texas, and Part 2 for Georgia. Each file contains over
1,500 variables, clustered in nine topic areas for each inmate: (1)
prison history (e.g., background information, psychological and
aptitude test data, and prior criminal and present incarceration
activity), (2-5) data from four personal interviews (conducted at the
prerelease, three-month, six-month, and 12-month stages and that
include living arrangements, employment history, and financial
status), (6) state arrest data, (7) records of TARP payments received,
(8) social security wages, and (9) parole records.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This study was an outcome evaluation of the Forever Free
 Substance Abuse Treatment Program at the California Institution for
 Women (CIW). Data were collected from 119 women who entered Forever
 Free between October 1997 and June 1998. Comparison data were
 collected from 96 women enrolled in Life Plan for Recovery, an
 eight-week substance abuse education course at CIW, between April and
 November 1998. Program participants completed an intake questionnaire,
 approximately one month after the beginning of treatment, designed to
 collect information on background, therapeutic alliance with
 counselors, group identification with fellow participants, treatment
 motivation, and psychological status. Members of the comparison group
 completed an intake form that collected background information.
 Treatment participants completed a pre-release form before leaving the
 program, which collected information on clients' therapeutic alliance
 with their counselors, psychological status, drug-related locus of
 control, and post-release treatment plans. Women in both groups
 participated in 12-month follow-up interviews between September 1999
 and August 2000, which were used to update background information and
 collect information on subjects' relationships with their children,
 drug use since release, substance abuse treatment since release,
 vocational training since release, services needed and received,
 social support, current treatment motivation, psychological status,
 and drug-related locus of control. Reincarceration data for the entire
 sample were obtained from the Offender-Based Information System, a
database maintained by the California Department of Corrections.</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">This study was an outcome evaluation of the
 Forever Free Substance Abuse Treatment Program at the California
 Institution for Women (CIW). The program, which began in 1991, was
 developed and is currently being operated by Mental Health Systems,
 Inc., under contract with the Office of Substance Abuse Programs of
 the California Department of Corrections. Forever Free is a modified
 therapeutic community with a curriculum that emphasizes relapse
 prevention, cognitive-behavioral skill building, and women's issues.
 At the time of the study, treatment was six months in duration and
 participants attended treatment for four hours per day in addition to
 their eight-hour work assignment in a prison job or educational
 program. A new cohort of about 30 women joined the program every six
 weeks. The in-custody phase of treatment was followed by up to six
 months of community residential treatment during parole
 supervision. The objectives of this study were to: (1) contrast the
 12-month post-release outcomes of Forever Free participants with those
 of a comparison group with regard to parole performance, drug use,
 employment, and psychological functioning, (2) examine differences
 between groups with regard to their relationships with their children
 following release to parole (custody status and parenting), (3)
 examine service needs during parole for both groups, and (4) determine
 outcome predictors for the whole sample and for Forever Free
 participants (tested predictors included group status, age, ethnicity,
 primary drug problem, criminal history, psychological functioning,
 level of therapeutic alliance, treatment readiness, and locus of
control).</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">Data were collected from 119 women who entered
 Forever Free between October 1997 and June 1998. Comparison data were
 collected from 96 women enrolled in Life Plan for Recovery, an
 eight-week substance abuse education course at CIW, between April and
 November 1998. Program participants completed an intake
 questionnaire, approximately one month after the beginning of
 treatment, designed to collect information on background, therapeutic
 alliance with counselors, group identification with fellow
 participants, treatment motivation, and psychological status. Those
 clients with reading difficulties had the questionnaire instrument
 read to them. Treatment participants completed the pre-release form
 approximately five months after completing the intake form. The
 pre-release form was designed to collect end-of-treatment information
 on clients' therapeutic alliance with their counselors, psychological
 status, drug-related locus of control, and post-release treatment
 plans. Members of the comparison group completed a separate intake
 form during their incarceration. Due to limited funds, less background
 information was collected from the women in the comparison group than
 from those in the treatment group. Women in both groups participated
 in 12-month follow-up interviews between September 1999 and August
 2000. Urine samples were obtained from a randomly selected 20 percent
 of subjects interviewed in Los Angeles, but these data are not
 included as part of this collection. Subjects who were incarcerated or
 selected for urine tests received face-to-face interviews (amounting
 to 61 percent of the sample). Residents of other counties who were not
 incarcerated received telephone interviews. The follow-up interview
 was used to update background information and collect information on
 subjects' relationships with their children, drug use since release,
 substance abuse treatment since release, vocational training received
 since release, services needed and received, social support, current
 treatment motivation, psychological status, and drug-related locus of
 control. Subjects providing urine samples received $50 to complete the
 interview and all other subjects interviewed received $45.
 Reincarceration data for the entire sample were obtained from the
 Offender-Based Information System, a database maintained by the
California Department of Corrections.</abstract>
      <abstract source="producer">Variables from the treatment group's intake form
 include date of interview, primary drug used, birth date, race, last
 job, 1996 household income, education, criminal history, relationship
 status, previous residence type, number of children, ages of children,
 whether the respondent had legal custody of children, where children
 were living, contact and visits with children, frequency with which
 certain parenting activities were performed before incarceration, drug
 use history, drug treatment history, answers to 30 questions about the
 respondent's counseling experience and case manager, answers to 13
 questions about interactions with other participants in Forever Free,
 answers to 43 questions relating to treatment motivation and
 psychological functioning, scales for self esteem, depression,
 anxiety, problem recognition, desire for help, treatment readiness,
 and therapist understanding and involvement, and total scores for
 therapeutic alliance with counselors, patient working capacity,
 working strategy consensus, client interaction, and confident
 collaboration. Variables from the pre-release form include whether the
 respondent planned to continue treatment after release, answers to the
 same 30 questions about the respondent's treatment experience and case
 manager that were on the intake form, answers to 16 questions about
 how the respondent felt about drug use, and answers to 19 questions
 about psychological functioning. Variables from the comparison group's
 intake form include interview date, primary drug used, birth date,
 race, 1996 household income, education, criminal history, relationship
 status, number of children under 18, drug use history, and release
 date. Variables from the follow-up interview include interview date,
 whether the respondent was incarcerated at the time of the interview,
 primary drug used, whether the interview was conducted face-to-face or
 over the phone, education and vocational training received since
 release, employment status, arrests and convictions since release,
 relationship status, residence type, where children were living,
 frequency with which certain parenting activities were performed, drug
 use history since release, substance abuse treatment since release,
 answers to 53 questions about whether certain services were needed by
 the respondent or her children since parole and whether these services
 were received, answers to 14 questions about social support available
 to the respondent, answers to 24 questions about whether certain
 services were received while at CIW and for how long, answers to 64
 questions about participants' satisfaction with the Forever Free
 program, answers to 78 questions about satisfaction with treatment
 received since release, answers to the same 43 questions on treatment
 motivation and psychological functioning as on the treatment group's
 intake form, answers to 16 questions about how the respondent felt
 about drug use, and a scale for drug-related locus of control.
 Variables from the Offender-Based Information System include status at
 end of follow-up, custody start date for intake offense, return to
 custody date for all times returned to custody during the 12-month
 follow-up period, parole date for all times paroled, penal code for
 offense that returned respondent to custody for all times returned to
 custody, number of returns to custody during the 12-month follow-up
 period, number of days incarcerated since release, and number of days
before first incarceration.</abstract>

      <abstract>The SCIRehab study collected data about 1,376 people with spinal cord injury across 7 disciplines at 6 facilities in the United States between 2007 and 2009 and followed for one year (until 2010). The 7 disciplines included in the study are Physical Therapy,  and Occupational Therapy, Psychology, Therapeutic Recreation, Social Work, Nursing, and Speech Language Pathology. These data include information gathered during 462,455 timed rehabilitation interventions in 282,999 treatment sessions provided by 1,094 clinicians. This study seeks to understand the relationship between rehabilitation and outcomes and used practice-based evidence methods to relate the details of the rehabilitation process to outcomes after controlling for individual demographic and injury characteristics. The 13 key outcomes include function and residence at discharge, 6 months and 1 year post injury, rehospitalization in the first year, 4 dimensions of societal participation, work or school attendance, depression, presence of pressure ulcers, and life satisfaction at 6 months and 1 year post injury.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This special topic poll, fielded December 12-13, 1998,
 sought respondents' views on the December 12, 1998, United States
 House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee vote to recommend that
 the full House impeach President Bill Clinton, and the ramifications
 of that recommendation. Those queried were asked whether they
 believed that Clinton should be impeached, removed from office, or
 censured and fined. Their views were also sought on whether Clinton
 lied under oath about having an affair with former White House intern
 Monica Lewinsky, whether such a lie about an extramarital affair was a
 sufficient reason to impeach a president, and whether Clinton
 obstructed justice. Respondents were asked whether they believed that
 Clinton concealed his affair with Lewinsky to prevent embarrassment or
 to help his case in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by
 former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. Additional topics covered
 the handling of the impeachment by both political parties, whether
 Clinton had cooperated with the House Judiciary Committee, the
 potential effect on the country if Clinton were removed from office,
 and whether Clinton should be criminally tried for perjury. Background
 information on respondents includes age, race, sex, political party,
 political orientation, education, and voter registration and
participation history.</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;This Gallup poll seeks the opinions of Canadians, on both political and social issues. The questions ask opinions about the Northwest Passage and other political issues within the country. There are also questions on other topics of interest and importance to the country and government, such as homosexuality, aids and the death penalty. The respondents were also asked questions so that they could be grouped according to geographical variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics of interest include: allowing a high speed police chase; the amount of homosexuals today; the causes of homosexuality; changes in the safety of air travel; controlling the Northwest passage; ideas about romance; the individuals who are most at risk for getting aids; knowledge of aids; the knowledge of the U.S. icebreaker in the Northwest Passage; the level of romance today, compared to the past; the location of summer holidays; the number of people who die from aids; rating safety records of major airlines; the satisfaction with airline safety procedures; spreading aids; supporting the death penalty; taking summer holidays; the United State's influence over the Canadian culture; what romance means; and who should be the head of state.&lt;/p&gt;

Basic demographic variables are also included.

      <abstract>This Gallup poll seeks the opinions of Canadians on various political and social issues. Subjects include discipline in schools, preferred political parties and leaders, and the overall development of the country. The respondents were also asked questions so that they could be grouped according to geographical and social variables. Topics of interest include: Canadian development; changes in savings; feelings towards the future; putting limits on debates in Parliament; the outcome of giving women more say; political preferences; the preferred size of the population; the proposed reconstruction of the Provinces; the sale of beer in grocery stores; satisfaction with the government; and the idea of going back to a two-party system in Canada. Basic demographic variables are also included.</abstract>

      <abstract>This annual survey, fielded July to September 2006, was
conducted in over 60 countries to solicit public opinion on social and
political issues. Respondents were asked for their opinions about
globalization, their opinions about several countries, and whether
they would like to live in those countries. The survey also asked the
respondents about the United States' involvement in the fight against
terrorism and about other issues such as the growth of the world
economy. Additional questions addressed Internet usage, terrorism in
the respondent's country, women's rights, education, and political
ideology. Demographic information includes sex, age, income, education
level, employment status, and religious affiliation.</abstract>

      <abstract>These data were collected using the National Electronic
 Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), the primary data system of the
 United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). CPSC began
 operating NEISS in 1972 to monitor product-related injuries treated in
 United States hospital emergency departments (EDs). In June 1992, the
 National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), within the
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, established an interagency
 agreement with CPSC to begin collecting data on nonfatal
 firearm-related injuries in order to monitor the incidents and the
 characteristics of persons with nonfatal firearm-related injuries
 treated in United States hospital EDs over time. This dataset
 represents all nonfatal firearm-related injuries (i.e., injuries
 associated with powder-charged guns) and all nonfatal BB and pellet
 gun-related injuries reported through NEISS from 1993 through
 2003. The cases consist of initial ED visits for treatment of the
 injuries. Cases were reported even if the patients subsequently died.
 Secondary visits and transfers from other hospitals were excluded.
 Information is available on injury diagnosis, firearm type, use of
 drugs or alcohol, criminal incident, and locale of the
 incident. Demographic information includes age, sex, and race of the
injured person.</abstract>

      <abstract><p> The Health and Life Study of Koreans (HLSK) was conducted as a part of the study, "Empirical Assessment of Respondent Driven Sampling from Total Survey Error Perspectives" supported by the National Science Foundation. The larger study aimed to examine the operational and inferential properties of respondent driven sampling (RDS).  HLSK applied RDS using a web survey, to examine the health of foreign-born Korean-American adults living in Los Angeles County or the State of Michigan. It should be noted that the literature on analysis of RDS data is not fully established, and there is less than clear empirical evidence illustrating the fit of using RDS for population-level inferences. Hence, data users are advised to exercise extreme caution in making population-level inferences.</p>
<p>This study uses existing questions from established surveys such as the American Community Survey (ACS), Kessler survey of psychological distress, and the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). The Main Survey covers topics like socio-demographics, physical and mental health, healthcare utilization, religiosity, political engagement, psychosocial traits, and racial/ethnic identity. The Follow-up Survey and Restricted Data focuses on RDS sampling questions and allows users to examine the relationships between recruiters and their recruits. Additionally, the Follow-up Survey and Restricted Data includes variables that contain sensitive information such as multi-racial identity, citizenship status, and physical health characteristics.</p></abstract>
      <abstract>This study's purpose was to improve how data is collected on hard to research communities by fielding a survey on  Korean Americans' wellbeing.</abstract>
      <abstract>This study used respondent driven sampling which starts with a number of eligible participants called seeds.   This survey started with 15 seeds in LA and 5 seeds in Michigan.  Once the seeds completed the survey, they were asked to recruit other eligible participants. The individuals recruited by the seeds were then asked to recruit their peers, and this chain referral process continued until the data collection period ended.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This survey was undertaken to assess consumer
 sentiment and savings behavior. Data were gathered on the role 
 that interest rates and service charges played in relation 
 to respondents' choice of savings institutions. Information was 
 also elicited on respondents' types of savings and financial 
 investments, savings patterns, balances and liquidity, spending 
 habits, and the use of savings account as a source of financing 
 for large expenditures. Open-ended questions were asked concerning 
 evaluations and expectations about personal finances, income 
 tax preparation and tax returns, employment, recession, price 
 changes, world events, and the national business situation. 
 Additional variables probe respondents' buying intentions for 
 a house, automobiles, appliances, and other consumer durables, 
 as well as respondents' appraisals of present market conditions 
 for purchasing houses and other durables. Other variables probe   
 respondents' perceptions of changes in interest rates and 
 contrasting bank interest rates, as well as their assessment
 of their own financial status relative to the previous year. 
 Demographic variables provide information on age, sex, race, 
marital status, education, occupation, and family income.</abstract>

      <abstract><p>This administrative dataset provides descriptive information about the families and children served through the federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF). CCDF dollars are provided to states, territories, and tribes to provide assistance to low-income families receiving or in transition from temporary public assistance, to obtain quality child care so they can work, or depending on their state's policy, to attend training or receive education. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 requires states and territories to collect information on all family units receiving assistance through the CCDF and to submit monthly case-level data to the Office of Child Care. States are permitted to report case-level data for the entire population, or a sample of the population, under approved sampling guidelines. </p>
<p>The Summary Records file contains monthly state-level summary information including the number of families served. The Family Records file contains family-level data including single parent status of the head of household, monthly co-payment amount, date on which child care assistance began, reasons for care (e.g., employment, training/education, protective services, etc.), income used to determine eligibility, source of income, and the family size on which eligibility is based. The Child Records file contains child-level data including ethnicity, race, gender, and date of birth. The Setting Records file contains information about the type of child care setting, the total amount paid to the provider, and the total number of hours of care received by the child. The Pooling Factor file provides state-level data on the percentage of child care funds that is provided through the CCDF, the federal Head Start region the grantee (state) is in and is monitored by, and the state FIPS code for the grantee. </p></abstract>

The State Legislative District Summary File Supplement contains geographic identification codes that relate each 2000 Census block to pre-2010 Census state legislative districts. Both upper and lower chamber districts are identified. In addition, these block-level data contain variables on land area, water area, latitude, longitude, total population size, and number of housing units, as well as geographic identification variables for other levels of observation such as states, metropolitan statistical areas, urban areas, congressional districts, counties, county subdivisions, places, census tracts, block groups, and ZIP code tabulation areas. There is one data file for each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico which are bundled together in a single ZIP archive. A second ZIP archive contains the codebook and other documentation.

    <search:metadata>
      <abstract>This data collection is part of the Monitoring the Future series that explores changes in important values, behaviors, and lifestyle orientations of contemporary American youth in eighth, tenth, and twelfth grades. The collection provides two datasets for each year since 1976 that are accessible only through the ICPSR Virtual Data Enclave VDE) and include original variables, including the unaltered weight variable, that in the public-use data were  altered or omitted: one dataset without State, County, and Zip Code and one dataset including State, County, and Zip Code. <hi>Use of the geographic identifiers such as state, county, or zip code is limited and researchers interested in these variables are encouraged to read <ExtLink URI="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/NAHDAP/faqs/mtf-restricted-version-faq.html">FAQs: About MTF Restricted-Use Geographic and Other Variables.</ExtLink></hi> Also included as part of each annual collection is a zip archive of the Monitoring the Future public-use data and documentation for each respective year. The basic research design used by the Monitoring the Future study involves annual data collections from eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders throughout the coterminous United States during the spring of each year. The 8th/10th grade surveys used four different questionnaire forms (and only two forms from 1991-1996) rather than the six used with seniors. Identical forms are used for both eighth and tenth grades, and for the most part, questionnaire content is drawn from the twelfth-grade questionnaires. Thus, key demographic variables and measures of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs are generally identical for all three grades. However, many fewer questions about lifestyles and values are included in the 8th/10th grade forms. Drugs covered by this survey include tobacco, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, hashish, prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, inhalants, steroids, LSD, hallucinogens, amphetamines (stimulants), Ritalin (methylphenidate), Quaaludes (methaqualone), barbiturates (tranquilizers), cocaine, crack cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin, and GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate). Other topics include attitudes toward religion, changing roles for women, educational aspirations, self-esteem, exposure to drug education, and violence and crime (both in and out of school).</abstract>

Note : Étant donné que les valeurs manquantes n'apparaissent pas dans ces ensembles de données, toute forme de non-réponse (e.g. saut valide, indéterminé) ou ne sais pas/refus ne peuvent pas être codées comme manquantes. L'étiquette "Sysmiss" dans la section statistique indique le nombre de records non-réponse pour chacune des variables et la valeur "valide" dans la section des statistiques indique que le nombre de records de répondants pour chaque variable. Le nombre total de records pour chaque variable est compris dans les deux, soit le "Symiss" et dans les "valeurs valides"

L'Enquête sur la population active (EPA) fournit des estimations de l'emploi et du chômage, lesquelles figurent parmi les mesures les plus actuelles et les plus importantes de la performance de l'économie canadienne. Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.

L'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. 

Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.

Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.

      <abstract source="producer">This collection presents responses to a set of questions
asked in both EURO-BAROMETER 35.0: FOREIGN RELATIONS, THE COMMON
AGRICULTURAL POLICY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS, SPRING 1991 (ICPSR
9697) and EURO-BAROMETER 35.1: PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND
BIOTECHNOLOGY, SPRING 1991 (ICPSR 9698). The survey queried
respondents on standard Eurobarometer measures, such as whether they
attempted to persuade others close to them to share their views on
subjects they held strong opinions about, whether they discussed
political matters, what their country's goals should be for the next
ten years, and whether their country had benefited from being a member
of the European Community (EC). The major focus of this collection
was working conditions. Respondents were asked about the main business
activity of the establishment where they worked, the number of hours
they worked daily and weekly, and whether they worked on shifts. They
were also asked whether their work involved dangerous machines, high
speed activity, tiring positions, heavy loads, tight deadlines, using
computers, or working at night, and whether they felt they had
sufficient resources, such as training, information, tools, and
support, to carry out their tasks. The survey also collected
information on safety, hygiene, and health standards at workplaces and
their influence on work efficiency. Respondents were asked whether
their professional activities affected their health or threatened them
with accident and injury, whether they had ever had work-related
illnesses or accidents, and who should be responsible for reduction of
accidents and work-related illnesses. Several items assessed awareness
of European Community efforts concerning safety, hygiene, and health
standards at work and support for the application of common
legislation in the EC member countries concerning health and safety
issues at work. Respondents were also asked which countries in the EC
had the most and the least advanced legislation in this area.
Demographic characteristics collected include gender, age, occupation,
marital status, religious affiliation and practice, age at completion
of education, subjective membership in social class, political and
trade union participation, home ownership, number of people in
household, family income, home ownership, subjective size of
community, and nationality. Selected standard Eurobarometer
constructed variables and indices are also included.</abstract>

The International Travel Survey (ITS) is an ongoing survey conducted by Statistics Canada since the 1920s to meet the requirements of the Canadian System of National Accounts (Balance of Payments (BOP). Through the years, the need for detailed characteristics of travellers for market research and industry planning was gradually incorporated in the survey. Today, the ITS provides a full range of statistics on the volume of international travellers and detailed characteristics of their trips such as expenditures, activities, places visited and length of stay. The ITS covers both Canadian residents returning from trips outside Canada and international visitors to Canada. In addition to fulfilling BOP requirements, the ITS is also being used by the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), Customs Canada, the Canadian tourism Commission (CTC), provincial tourism agencies, the United States Department of Commerce and a number of private sector industries. The ITS is also used for reporting to international organizations such as the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Pacific-Asia Tourism Association.

 characteristics of aliens who became legal permanent residents of the 
 United States in fiscal year 1984 (October 1983 through September 
 1984). Data are presented for two types of immigrants. The first 
 category, New Arrivals, arrived from outside the United States with 
 valid immigrant visas issued by the United States Department of State. 
 Those in the second category, Adjustments, were already in the United 
 States with temporary status and were adjusted to legal permanent 
 residence through petition to the United States Immigration and 
 Naturalization Service. Variables include port of entry, month and year 
 of admission, class of admission, and state and area to which 
 immigrants were admitted. Demographic information such as age, sex, 
 marital status, occupation, country of birth, country of last permanent 
residence, and nationality is also provided.</abstract>

 parents were interviewed again in 1973, 1982, and 1997. In addition,
 the children of these parents were interviewed in 1997. Each child's
 1997 data has been merged with their parent's data and their
 corresponding grandparent's data. Since two, one, or zero grandparents
 were interviewed for each parent in 1965, there may be one or two

      <abstract>
As a result of the Canadian Federal Election held on Monday June 28, 2004, the Liberal Party formed a minority government. Telephone surveys, conducted during the campaign and after the election with a random sample of Canadians, provide data that can be used to help explain the election outcome.
&lt;p&gt;Within 17 months, Canadians again went to the polls and the result of the January 23, 2006 vote was a second minority government, but under the leadership of the Conservative Party. Efforts were made to interview the respondents to the 2004 survey again for the 2006 survey and about one-half of the 2004 survey respondents also answered the 2006 survey. These re-interviews provide a panel or longitudinal sample component where a respondent's answers to questions in the first survey can be compared to those of the second survey. Many of the questions asked in 2004 were repeated in the 2006 survey. The remaining respondents to the 2006 survey were a random sample of Canadians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2008 Canadian Election Study consists of a survey with nearly 4500 eligible voters conducted during the second half of the election campaign. 3689 of these respondents completed a post-election survey as well. 1238 respondents who had participated in the 2004-2006 panel study were also interviewed after the election. All of the interviews were conducted by telephone. The final component of the study was a self-administered mail-back survey completed by 1939 respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2011 Canadian Election Study consists of 4 waves. Note that each survey wave is a different questionnaire: CPS is the Campaign Period Survey (by telephone), PES is the Post-Election Survey (by telephone), MBS is the Mailback Survey, and WEB is the final Web-based survey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>Section 71 of the Access to Information Act requires federal ministries, crown corporations, and other agencies to make manuals given to employees available at facilities at their headquarters. For most Canadians, the national headquarters are inaccessible.    In 2012, a petition to the House of Commons asked that the manuals be posted on-line. The President of the Treasury Board of Canada responded saying that the manuals were accessible through to those who use the Access to Information Act.  Manuals here have been acquired here through the Access to Information Act and are made available here in accordance with fair dealing section of the Copyright Act.   Currently, the manuals are from: Citizenship and Immigration Canada (2011)</abstract>

 between parents and children, parents' living arrangements with adult
 child's family and its benefits and disadvantages, social engagements
 such as attendance at political meetings, religious activities,
 volunteer work, and theater outings, work and retirement history, and
 opinions on gender equity and individualism. The Baoding Parent Data

      <abstract>This Gallup poll seeks the opinions of Canadians, on predominantly political issues. The questions ask opinions about political leaders and political issues within the country. There are also questions on other topics of interest and importance to the country and government, such as price protection for newly developed drugs and child care costs. The respondents were also asked questions so that they could be grouped according to geographic and social variables. Topics of interest include: allowing homemakers to have a pension plan; attitudes towards the Commonwealth; the best politician to be Prime Minister of Canada; the characteristics associated with Brian Mulroney; the characteristics associated with Ed Broadbent; the characteristics associated with John Turner; concern over the dissolving of the Commonwealth; paying for a homemaker's pension plan; price protection for newly developed drugs; and who should pay for child care. Basic demographic variables are also included.</abstract>

      <abstract>The building located at 352 Somerset Street West in Ottawa is more than a century old. Better known as Somerset House, it was originally constructed in 1896 [1] to house the Crosby, Caruthers Dry Goods Company. The original 3 storey brick building located at the corner of Bank Street and Somerset Street West was expanded by adding a 4 storey brick addition to the rear in 1902. This is a capstone project compiled by a group of undergraduate students of the Architectural Conservation and Sustainability Program (Engineers and architects) at Carleton University for the CIVE4819 Capstone project.</abstract>

      <abstract>
The primary objective of the survey is to obtain the views of all employees of the federal Public Service about their workplaces. The information will allow managers and employees to initiate concrete actions in their own department, and where warranted, across the Public Service. 

The effects of Program Review, government restructuring, increased workload and rapid technological advances have greatly affected federal Public Service employees. Recent studies and reports on specific segments of the federal Public Service had shown that low morale was prevalent among executives and knowledge workers and that many employees felt that workplace conditions were not conducive to confidence in management, job satisfaction and career advancement. Much additional information was required in order to further evaluate these findings and determine how the present workplace structure could be improved to meet the challenges facing it at the turn of the new millennium.

In 1997, the Clerk of the Privy Council introduced the idea of a voluntary survey of all federal Public Service employees. The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) was asked to implement the project. The TBS worked in consultation with other key federal departments to develop a national survey that would gather information from all employees through a common questionnaire. As part of the project, Statistics Canada was asked to participate in the development and to collect and process the data. 

The survey results will be used to develop actions at the level of the department, sector or branch and ultimately at the work unit level. The results would also serve as input to the future corporate management agenda. The survey will provide a baseline against which future progress in renewing the workplace can be measured.

The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is conducted annually to obtain work experience and income information from Canadian households. The Survey provides up-to-date information on the distribution and sources of income, before and after taxes, for families and individuals. With this file, users may identify specific family types, such as two-parent and lone-parent families. Information is also provided on earnings, transfers, and total income for the head and the spouse of the census family unit, as well as personal and labour-related characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;This reference year for this file is 1979.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commencing with the 1998 microdata files, annual cross-sectional income data will be sourced from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID).&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Travel Survey of Residents of Canada is a major source of data used to measure the size and status of Canada's tourism industry. It was developed to mesure the volume, the characteristics and the economic impact of domestic travel. Since the beginning of 2005 this survey replaces the Canada Travel Survey (CTS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It measures the size of domestic travel in Canada from the demand side. The objectives of the survey are to provide information about the volume of trips and expenditures for Canadian residents by trip origin, destination, duration, type of accommodation used, trip reason, mode of travel, etc.; to provide information on travel incidence and to provide the socio-demographic profile of travellers and non-travellers. Estimates allow quarterly analysis at the national, provincial and tourism region level (with varying degrees of precision) on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total volume of same-day and overnight trips taken by the residents of Canada with destinations in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;same-day and overnight visits in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;main purpose of the trip/key activities on trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spending on same-day and overnight trips taken in Canada by Canadian residents in total and by category of expenditure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modes of transportation (main/other) used on the trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person-visits, household-visits, spending in total and by expense category for each location visited in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person- and party-nights spent in each location visited in Canada, in total and by type of accommodation used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of travel packages and associated spending and use of motor coach/other guided tours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source of payment (household, government, private employer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demographics of adults that took or did not take trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;travel party composition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three files for this survey - Trip File, Visit File, and Person File.&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract source="producer">This study explores the psychology of decision-making by 
 examining the subjective and intuitive elements of expert and lay risk 
 assessments. For the study, members of the United States Society of 
 Toxicology and the lay public were surveyed about basic toxicological 
 concepts, assumptions, and interpretations regarding risk of chemical 
 toxicology. Chemicals were defined as including all chemical elements 
 and compounds, including pesticides, food additives, industrial 
 chemicals, household cleaning agents, and prescription and 
 nonprescription drugs. The researchers began by identifying several 
 fundamental principles and judgmental components within the science of 
 risk assessment. Questions were developed based on these fundamentals 
 in order to determine the extent to which lay people and experts share 
 the same beliefs and conceptual framework. Questions addressed the 
 following four topics: (1) dose-response sensitivity, (2) trust in 
 animal and bacterial studies, (3) attitudes toward chemicals, and (4) 
 attitudes toward reducing chemical risks. Demographic information for 
 Demographic information for expert data include highest academic degree 
 earned, fields of study, age, sex, race, health, organizational 
 affiliation, and current position at work. Demographic information for 
 lay public data include education, age, sex, marital status, race, 
 children, health, present employment status, career, and annual 
household income.</abstract>

      <abstract><p>The Eurobarometer series is a unique cross-national and cross-temporal survey program conducted on behalf of the European Commission. These surveys regularly monitor public opinion in the European Union (EU) member countries and consist of standard modules and special topic modules. The standard modules address attitudes towards European unification, institutions and policies, measurements for general socio-political orientations, as well as respondent and household demographics. The special topic modules address such topics as agriculture, education, natural environment and resources, public health, public safety and crime, and science and technology. </p>
<p> This round of Eurobarometer surveys covers the following special topics: (1) Europe 2020 strategy, (2) the financial and economic crisis, (3) European citizenship, and (4) information on EU political matters. Opinions were collected on the European economic crisis and the importance of the Europe 2020 strategies for improving the crisis. Respondents were also asked about their thoughts on the effects of the formation of the European Union and the rights of its citizens. Additional information includes respondents' sources of political knowledge and to what extent they feel well informed on political matters.</p>
<p>Demographic and other background information collected include age, gender, nationality, marital status and parental relations, occupation, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, ownership of durable goods, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, and Internet use. In addition, country-specific data includes type and size of locality, region of residence, and language of interview (select countries).</p></abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This data collection contains measurements of civil 
 strife for 114 nations for the period 1961-1965. Data are
 provided for three basic forms of strife: conspiracy, internal
 war, and turmoil, and for all types of strife taken together, 
 as well as for the predicted magnitude of strife, measures
 of deprivation, and measures of mediating variables. Variables
 that measure three characteristics of strife for each nation
 are pervasiveness, duration, and intensity. Measures of
 deprivation include economic and political and long- and 
 short-term deprivation. Indices of deprivation include economic 
 discrimination, political discrimination, potential separatism, 
 dependence on foreign capital, religious cleavages, and lack 
 of educational opportunities. Measures of mediating variables 
 include legitimacy, coercive potential, institutionalization, 
past strife levels, and facilitation of strife.</abstract>

      <abstract>For this data collection, mayors, city council finance
committee chairs, and chief administrative officers/city managers in
all United States cities with populations over 25,000 were surveyed.
Topics covered include the relative importance of professional as
opposed to elected officials in fiscal management, and preferences for
and implementation of changes in spending levels in 13 policy areas
(e.g., education, social welfare, streets, and police protection).
Respondents also were queried about policy preferences, activities, and
impact on city government of 20 groups (including employees, business
groups, local media, the elderly, city finance staff, and federal and
state agencies). In addition, questions were asked on city finance
problems (e.g., loss of federal or state revenue, declining tax base,
and pressures from municipal employees), fiscal management strategies
the city had used (e.g., contracting out, user fees, privatization),
revenue forecasting, integrated financial management systems,
performance measures, management rights, and level of sophistication of
economic development analyses. Background information on mayors
includes terms served, years spent in elected office, political party
identification, use of local media, age, ethnicity/race, sex, religious
preference, and education. In addition to the survey data, detailed
structural data on population, economic structures, industry, and the
labor force are provided.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">The purpose of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 
 is to obtain information about the amount and distribution of illness, 
 its effects in terms of disability and chronic impairments, and the 
 kinds of health services people receive. This supplement includes 
 variables from the NHIS core Person File (see NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW 
 SURVEY, 1993 [ICPSR 6534]), including sex, age, race, marital status, 
 veteran status, education, income, industry and occupation codes, and 
 limits on activity. The Year 2000 Supplement also contains items on 
 nine selected topics that relate to the Department of Health and Human 
 Services (HHS) Year 2000 Health Objectives: environmental health, 
 tobacco use, nutrition, occupational safety and health, heart disease, 
 other chronic and disabling conditions, clinical and preventive 
 services, mental health, and oral health. Among the variables included 
 in this supplement are type of residence, whether the home was built 
 before 1950, whether household air was tested for radon, current 
 smoking status, current activities to control weight, 
 employer-sponsored exercise programs, amount of stress in the past 
 year, and the effect of stress on health in the past year. Variables 
 included in the sections on mental health and oral health include the 
 amount of stress in the past two weeks and in the past year, total 
 number of dental visits in the past 12 months, loss of teeth, and 
general health status.</abstract>

      <abstract>These data provide information on the number of arrests reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program each month by police agencies in the United States. Although not as well known as the "Crimes Known to the Police" data drawn from the Uniform Crime Report's Return A form, the arrest reports by age, sex, and race provide valuable data on 43 offenses including violent, drug, gambling, and larceny crimes. The data received by ICPSR were structured as a hierarchical file containing (per reporting police agency) an agency header record, and 1 to 12 monthly header reports, and 1 to 43 detail offense records containing the counts of arrests by age, sex, and race for a particular offense. ICPSR restructured the original data to a rectangular format.</abstract>
      <abstract>n/a</abstract>
      <abstract>The data for the Uniform Crime Reports are submitted voluntarily by city, county, and state law enforcement agencies. Some agencies receive forms directly from the FBI and return them directly to the FBI. Many others receive forms from state collecting programs and return the reports to those programs. The state programs, in turn, forward the reports to the FBI. Reports are sent out and collected on a monthly basis.</abstract>

      <abstract>
L’Enquête sur la santé dans les collectivités canadiennes (l'ESCC) est une enquête transversale qui vise à recueillir des renseignements sur l’état de santé, l’utilisation des services de santé et les déterminants de la santé de la population canadienne. Le cycle de collecte des données de l’ESCC s’étend sur deux années. La première année du cycle, indiquée par la notation « .1 », correspond à une enquête générale sur la santé de la population réalisée auprès d’un grand échantillon et conçue pour fournir des estimations fiables au niveau de la région socio-sanitaire. La deuxième année du cycle, représentée par la notation « .2 », correspond à une enquête de moins grande portée conçue pour fournir des données au niveau provincial sur des sujets particuliers ayant trait à la santé.

Les objectifs principaux du cycle 1.1 de l’ESCC sont les suivants :

• fournir des estimations transversales à jour et fiables des déterminants de la santé, de l’état de santé et de l’utilisation des services de santé à travers le Canada;
• recueillir des données au niveau infraprovincial;
• créer un instrument d’enquête souple permettant :
- de combler des lacunes statistiques particulières au niveau de la région socio-sanitaire;
- d’élaborer un contenu d’enquête thématique en vue de recueillir des données importantes;
- de répondre aux nouvelles questions ayant trait à la santé et aux services de santé à mesure qu’elles surviennent.

Le présent fichier de microdonnées contient les données du cycle 1.1 de l’ESCC, c’est-à-dire la première année du cycle. Les renseignements ont été recueillis de septembre 2000 à novembre 2001 pour 136 régions socio-sanitaires couvrant les dix provinces et les trois territoires. Les données du cycle 1.1 de l’ESCC sont recueillies auprès des personnes de 12 ans et plus vivant dans des logements privés. Sont exclus de la base de sondage les habitants des réserves indiennes et des terres de la Couronne, les résidents des établissements, les membres à temps plein des Forces armées canadiennes et les habitants de certaines régions éloignées. L’ESCC couvre environ 98 % de la population canadienne âgée de 12 ans et plus.

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) Roma Pilot Survey was carried out in 2011. The survey documents the situation on the ground, providing policy makers with the necessary evidence for designing effective policy responses to address the situation of the millions of Roma who continue to face discrimination and social exclusion across the European Union (EU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study collected data on the socio-economic condition, experiences of discrimination and rights awareness of Roma in 11 EU Member States: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. Specifically, the survey focused on respondents’ situation with respect to employment, education, housing and health. The survey also included questions concerning the socio-demographic characteristics of all household members as well as the surrounding neighbourhood and its infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRA carried out the survey as a part of its multi-annual Roma programme. The development of the survey content as well as the sampling and fieldwork were coordinated with the European Commission, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank. These three organisations carried out a regional Roma survey in 2011, which covered five countries where FRA also collected data, in addition to six non-EU countries in the western Balkans and Moldova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FRA survey interviewed 10,811 Roma and 5,508 non-Roma living nearby – that is, the survey provides data on a total of 16,319 households as well as selected characteristics of all members of these households.  Participation in the survey was voluntary, and at the beginning of each interview the respondents could say whether they consider themselves Roma or not. The term ‘Roma’, as used by the Council of Europe, refers to Roma, Sinti, Kale and related groups in Europe, including Travellers and the Eastern groups (Dom and Lom). It also covers the wide diversity of the groups concerned, including persons who identify themselves as Gypsies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey data can also be explored online using the FRA's Roma Pilot Survey &lt;a href="http://fra.europa.eu/DVS/DVT/roma.php" target="_blank"&gt;Data Explorer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <abstract source="producer">This study contains data from interviews with members 
 of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) 
 on their attitudes towards arms deployment and arms control by 
 the United States, as well as biographical and professional 
 background information. Respondents were asked questions about 
 their commitment to and intellectual interest in arms control, 
 the importance of arms control as a foreign policy issue, basic 
 orientation to arms control, and the effects of their job 
 position on their attitude towards arms control. Also elicited
 were respondents' perceptions of the influence of the ACDA,
 Department of State, Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other 
 influences over policy. Respondents were queried about their 
 reaction to the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) I 
 agreement, their preference for SALT II, the Comprehensive Test 
 Ban Treaty, and expenditures for strategic nuclear weapons. 
 Demographic variables include age, education, and job rank. In
 addition, biographical information is provided for other members
of the ACDA who were not interviewed.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Afrobarometer project was designed to assess attitudes toward democracy, governance, economic reform, quality of life, and civil society in several Sub-Saharan African nations, and to track the evolution of such attitudes in those nations over time. This particular survey was concerned with the attitudes and opinions of the citizens of Zimbabwe. Respondents in a face-to-face interview were asked to rate Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and his administration's overall performance, to state the most important issues facing the nation, and to evaluate the effectiveness of certain continental and international institutions. Opinions were gathered on the role of the government in improving the economy, whether corruption existed in local and national government, whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, and whether local government officials, the police, the courts, the overall criminal justice system, the media, the National Electoral Commission, and the government broadcasting service could be trusted. Respondents were polled on their knowledge of government officials, their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, their participation in national elections, the inclusiveness of the government, and the identification of causes of conflict and resources that may aid in the resolution of conflict. Economic questions addressed the past, present, and future of the country's and the respondent's economic condition, and whether great income disparities are fair. Societal questions were asked of respondents concerning the meaning of being "poor" and "rich," monetary support systems, personal responsibility for success or failure, characteristics used in self-identification, methods for securing food, water, schooling, medical services, news and information, and ease of obtaining assistance for certain services. Background variables include age, gender, ethnicity, education, religious affiliation and participation, political party affiliation, language spoken most at home, whether respondent was head of household, current and past employment status, whether a close friend or relative had died from AIDS, language used in interview, and type of physical disability, if any. In addition, demographic information pertaining to the interviewer is provided, as well as their response to the interview and observations of the respondent's attitude during the interview and of the interview environment.</abstract>

      <abstract>
L'Enquête sur la population active (EPA) fournit des estimations de l'emploi et du chômage, lesquelles figurent parmi les mesures les plus actuelles et les plus importantes de la performance de l'économie canadienne. Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.

L'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. 

Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. 

Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.

L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note importante&lt;/strong&gt; : Étant donné que les valeurs manquantes n'apparaissent pas dans ces ensembles de données, toute forme de non-réponse (e.g. saut valide, indéterminé) ou ne sais pas/refus ne peuvent pas être codées comme manquantes. L'étiquette "Sysmiss" dans la section statistique indique le nombre de records non-réponse pour chacune des variables et la valeur "valide" dans la section des statistiques indique que le nombre de records de répondants pour chaque variable. Le nombre total de records pour chaque variable est compris dans les deux, soit le "Symiss" et dans les "valeurs valides". Pour obtenir de l'information sur les valeurs manquantes, veuillez consulter les tableaux de fréquences pour chaque mois de l'Enquête sur la population active.&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract><p>The 2014 Child Care Licensing Study provides information collected about child care licensing programs and policies and the regulations for childcare centers, family child care homes, and group child care homes for all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the two U.S. Territories (Guam and the Virgin Islands). The data about States and Territories' licensing policies, including facility monitoring, enforcement of licensing regulations, and licensing program staffing, were gathered by the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA) in the 2014 NARA Child Care Licensing Programs and Policies Survey. NARA sent an online survey to all state child care licensing agencies in September 2014. Respondents submitted their answers via the Internet, and by January 2015, all States had responded.</p>
<p>The data from the Licensing Survey cover the following topical areas:</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<itm>Number of licensed facilities</itm>
<itm>Complaint investigations</itm>
<itm>Licensing staff</itm>
<itm>Enforcement actions</itm>
<itm>Types of inspections</itm>
<itm>Licensing information on the Internet</itm>
<itm>Frequency of inspections</itm>
<itm>Licensing fees</itm>
<itm>Frequency of licensing</itm>
<itm>Licensing staff requirements</itm>
<itm>Inspections and monitoring</itm>
<itm>Licensing's role in quality initiatives</itm></list>
<p>The child care center licensing regulations used for this study were compiled by the National Center for Early Childhood Quality Assurance from the regulations posted on the National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care and Early Education (NRC) website between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014. That site is no longer active but directs users to the <ExtLink URI="https://childcareta.acf.hhs.gov/licensing">National Database of Child Care Licensing Regulations</ExtLink>. The licensing regulations data cover the following areas:</p>
<list type="bulleted">
<itm>Licensing regulations</itm>
<itm>Additional staff training requirements</itm>
<itm>Definition of licensed child care centers</itm>
<itm>Child-staff ratios and group size</itm>
<itm>Staff roles and age requirements</itm>
<itm>Supervision of children</itm>
<itm>Staff qualifications and ongoing training requirements</itm>
<itm>Care of children</itm>
<itm>Facility requirements and</itm>
<itm>Staff hiring requirements</itm></list>
<p>The same web site was used to collect licensing regulations covering the above listed topics for small family child care homes and large/group family child care homes. </p></abstract>
      <abstract><p>The role of licensing in the early care and education system is to provide a mandatory floor of program standards and monitoring that will protect children from physical harm and enhance learning and development. Within the early care and education system, licensing covers the broadest content, the largest number of children ages birth to school-age, and the largest population of providers.</p>
<p>Using data compiled from state child care licensing regulations and the results of a survey of state licensing agencies, research briefs examine the state of licensing in 2014 and identify trends that have become apparent during several years of data collection. The findings provide evidence that states are making positive changes in their licensing requirements and policies to protect the health and safety of children in out-of-home care.</p></abstract>

      <abstract><p>The purpose of this project was to measure and estimate the
distribution of personal income in both rural and urban areas of the
People's Republic of China. The principal investigators based their
definition of income on cash payments and on a broad range of
additional components: payments in kind valued at market prices,
agricultural output produced for self-consumption valued at market
prices, the value of food and other direct subsidies, and the imputed
value of housing services. The rural component of this collection
consists of two data files, one in which the individual is the unit of
analysis (Part 1) and a second in which the household is the unit of
analysis (Part 2). Individual rural respondents reported on their employment
status, level of education, Communist Party membership, type of
employer (e.g., public, private, or foreign), type of economic sector
in which they were employed, occupation, whether they held a second job,
retirement status, monthly pension, monthly wage, and other sources of
income. Demographic variables include relationship to householder,
gender, age, and student status. Rural households reported extensively
on the character of the household and residence. Information was
elicited on type of terrain surrounding the house, geographic
position, type of house, and availability of electricity. Also
reported were sources of household income (e.g., farming, industry,
government, rents, and interest), taxes paid, value of farm, total
amount and type of cultivated land, financial assets and debts,
quantity and value of various crops, amount of grain purchased or
provided by a collective, use of chemical fertilizers, gasoline, and
oil, quantity and value of agricultural machinery, and all household
expenditures (e.g., food, fuel, medicine, education, transportation,
and electricity). The urban component of this collection also consists
of two data files, one in which the individual is the unit of analysis (Part 3)
and a second in which the household is the unit of analysis (Part 4).
Individual urban respondents reported on their economic status within
the household, Communist Party membership, sex, age, nature of
employment, and relationship to the household head. Information was
collected on all types and sources of income from each member of the
household whether working, nonworking, or retired, all revenue
received by owners of private or individual enterprises, and all
in-kind payments (e.g., food, durable goods, and nondurable goods). Urban
households reported total income (including salaries, interest on
savings and bonds, dividends, rent, leases, alimony, gifts, and
boarding fees), all types and values of food subsidies received, and
total debt. Information was also gathered on household accommodations
and living conditions, including number of rooms, total living area in
square meters, availability and cost of running water, sanitary
facilities, heating and air-conditioning equipment, kitchen
availability, location of residence, ownership of home, and
availability of electricity and telephone. Households reported on all
their expenditures including amounts spent on food items such as
wheat, rice, edible oils, pork, beef and mutton, poultry, fish and
seafood, sugar, and vegetables by means of coupons in state-owned
stores and at free market prices. Information was also collected on
rents paid by the households, fuel available, type of transportation
used, and availability and use of medical and child care.</p>

      <abstract>The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
 (PHDCN) was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families,
 schools, and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent
 development. One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort
 Study, which was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that
 followed over 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young
 adults, and their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing
 circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,
 that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
 behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to
 gauge various aspects of human development, including individual
 differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. The Self
 Report of Offending was a self-report questionnaire focused on a
 participant's involvement in antisocial behavior and the legal
consequences of that behavior.</abstract>

 Neighborhoods (PHDCN) was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of
 how families, schools, and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent
 development. It was designed to advance the understanding of the
 developmental pathways of both positive and negative human social
 behaviors. In particular, the project examined the causes and pathways
 of juvenile delinquency, adult crime, substance abuse, and
 violence. At the same time, the project provided a detailed look at
 the environments in which these social behaviors took place by
 collecting substantial amounts of data about urban Chicago, including
 its people, institutions, and resources.</p> <p><hi>Longitudinal

 questionnaire focused on a participant's involvement in antisocial
behavior and the legal consequences of that behavior.</p></abstract>
      <abstract><p><hi>Project on Human Development in Chicago
 Neighborhoods</hi></p> <p>The city of Chicago was selected as the
 research site for the PHDCN because of its extensive racial, ethnic,
 and social-class diversity. The project collapsed 847 census tracts in
 the city of Chicago into 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon
 seven groupings of racial/ethnic composition and three levels of
 socioeconomic status. The NCs were designed to be ecologically
 meaningful. They were composed of geographically contiguous census
 tracts and geographic boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's
 neighborhoods were considered in the definition of the NCs. Each NC
 was comprised of approximately 8,000 people.</p> <p><hi>Longitudinal
 Cohort Study</hi></p> <p>For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a
 stratified probability sample of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80
 NCs were sampled from the 21 strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by
 three socioeconomic levels) with the goal of representing the 21 cells
 as equally as possible to eliminate the confounding between
 racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic status. Once the 80 NCs were
 chosen, then block groups were selected at random within each of the
 sample neighborhoods. A complete listing of dwelling units was
 collected for all sampled block groups. Pregnant women, children, and
 young adults in seven age cohorts (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18
 years) were identified through in-person screening of approximately
 40,000 dwelling units within the 80 NCs. The screening response rate
 was 80 percent. Children within six months of the birthday that
 qualified them for the sample were selected for inclusion in the
 Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of 8,347 participants were
 identified through the screening. Of the eligible study participants,
 6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data collection, and 5,338 were
 interviewed in the Wave 2 data collection.</p> <p>Data collection for
 Wave 2 began in 1997 and ended in 2000. It included a letter sent to
 study participants notifying them that they would be contacted to
 schedule an interview. This letter explained the study,
 reimbursements, and offered a monthly drawing prize of $1,000 for
 those participants who kept their first scheduled appointment. A toll
 free number was also included in the letter, so participants could
 call and schedule their own interviews or ask questions.</p> <p>For
 all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the child
 were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to spend
 the most time taking care of the child. Separate research assistants
 administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child
 interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face
 interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the
 personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated
 telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in
 Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 2 who lived
 outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants
 were able to travel for interviews. A total of 221 telephone
 interviews were conducted during Wave 2, representing 3.55 percent of
 the sample.</p> <p>Proxy interviews were conducted with study
 participants who were emancipated minors (under 18 but married or
 living independently). The study participants answered questions from
 the primary caregiver's interview on the primary caregiver's
 behalf. In Wave 2, four primary caregivers and two study participants
 were interviewed in jail. Study participants in foster care could not
 be interviewed. The Department of Children and Family Services did not
 allow interviews of the foster parent or the child. Permission was
 granted for a brief period in Wave 1, therefore there are some
 children in the sample who could not be followed up in Waves 2 and
 3. Some children were not in foster care in Wave 1 but were placed in
 foster care by Wave 2 or 3. They were also not followed up. Lastly,
 some participants were interviewed in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as
 they were in foster care during Wave 2.</p> <p>Some participants in
 Wave 1 spoke a language other than English, Spanish, or Polish. In
 Wave 2, an abbreviated version of the primary caregiver's protocol was
 administered, and the research assistant arranged for someone in the
 household to translate on the spot. In Wave 2, the complete protocol
 was translated into Spanish, and a subset of the primary caregiver's
 interview was translated into Polish.</p> <p>Depending on the age and
 wave of data collection, participants were paid between $5 and $20 per
 interview. Other incentives, such as free passes to museums, the
 aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes were also included.</p>
 <p>Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For
 example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking
 traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,
 delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and
 self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also
 interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,
 parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental
 health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.</p>
 <p><hi>Self Report of Offending</hi></p> <p> The Self Report of
 Offending was adapted from the Self-Report of Delinquency
 Questionnaire and the Self-Report of Antisocial Behavior Questionnaire
 to cover ages seven to adulthood. Information about lifetime and past
 year involvement in 35 delinquent and criminal behaviors (including
 theft, assault, and public disorder) was obtained with follow-up
 prompts designed to obtain information about age of onset and date of
 recent involvement as well as other factors such as police involvement
 or solitary versus group offending. Information regarding the
 participant's involvement with the police and court system was also
obtained.</p></abstract>
      <abstract>The data files contain information regarding the
 participant's involvement in various delinquent acts or crimes, such
 as truancy, weapon use, public disorder, arson, theft, fraud, illegal
 drug use, assault, illegal sexual activities, and traffic violations.
 In addition, data were collected regarding the consequences of the
 participant's activities, including information regarding treatment
programs, court appearances, and legal outcomes.</abstract>

      <abstract>
Ce fichier de microdonnées à grande diffusion renferme des données non agrégées associées à une vaste gamme de variables recueillies dans le cadre de l'Enquête sur la population active (EPA). L'EPA recueille des renseignements mensuels sur l'activité de la population canadienne en âge de travailler. Ce produit est destiné aux utilisateurs qui préfèrent réaliser leur propre analyse et qui s'intéressent à des sous-groupes particuliers de la population ou qui désirent effectuer des recoupements de variables ne faisant pas partie de nos produits catalogués.

Le fichier renferme les caractéristiques personnelles de tous les membres du ménage et les caractéristiques détaillées de l'activité de tous les membres du ménage âgés de 15 ans et plus. Parmi les caractéristiques personnelles figurent l'âge, le sexe, l'état matrimonial, le niveau d'instruction et les caractéristiques de la famille. Les caractéristiques détaillées de l'activité comprennent des renseignements sur l'emploi, comme la catégorie de travailleurs, les heures habituellement et effectivement travaillées, le salaire horaire et hebdomadaire de l'employé, la branche d'activité associée à l'emploi actuel ou au dernier emploi, le secteur public ou privé, la couverture syndicale, les heures supplémentaires rémunérées et non rémunérées, la permanence de l'emploi, les heures de travail perdues, la durée de l'emploi, de même que les renseignements sur le chômage, comme la durée du chômage, les méthodes de recherche d'emploi et le genre de travail recherché. Les données sur les caractéristiques de l'activité des étudiants pendant l'année scolaire et pendant la période estivale, sur la fréquentation scolaire à temps plein ou à temps partiel ainsi que sur le type d'établissement sont également disponibles. Ces données et d'autres renseignements sont disponibles selon la province et pour les trois principales régions métropolitaines de recensement (Montréal, Toronto et Vancouver).

Il s'agit d'un fichier mensuel, et les données disponibles remontent à 1976.

attitudes of police officers in three metropolitan areas toward their
work and the organizations and publics with which they
interact. Issues of interest include (1) the nature of police careers
and police work, and officers' satisfaction with their jobs, (2)
officers' orientations toward policing tasks and their relationships
with the public, and (3) officers' perceptions of organizations and
systems that influence or change police work.</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;This public-use microdata file is from the 1974 Canadian Family Expenditure Survey data.  The survey was carried out in January, February and March 1975 and refers to calendar year 1974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Survey of Family Expenditure of 1974 is the first survey since 1972 and was designed to provide information for persons living in private households in 14 major urban centres of  Canada.  Users should note that data on detailed food expenditure for 1974 were collected in a separate survey (see Statistics Canada Catalogue Number 62-542).  The Food Survey had the same coverage as the Family Expenditure Survey of 1974.&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Travel Survey of Residents of Canada (TSRC) is a major source of data used to measure the size and status of Canada's tourism industry. It was developed to mesure the volume, the characteristics and the economic impact of domestic travel. Since the beginning of 2005 this survey replaces the Canada Travel Survey (CTS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It measures the size of domestic travel in Canada from the demand side. The objectives of the survey are to provide information about the volume of trips and expenditures for Canadian residents by trip origin, destination, duration, type of accommodation used, trip reason, mode of travel, etc.; to provide information on travel incidence and to provide the socio-demographic profile of travellers and non-travellers. Estimates allow quarterly analysis at the national, provincial and tourism region level (with varying degrees of precision) on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total volume of same-day and overnight trips taken by the residents of Canada with destinations in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;same-day and overnight visits in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;main purpose of the trip/key activities on trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spending on same-day and overnight trips taken in Canada by Canadian residents in total and by category of expenditure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modes of transportation (main/other) used on the trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person-visits, household-visits, spending in total and by expense category for each location visited in Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;person- and party-nights spent in each location visited in Canada, in total and by type of accommodation used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use of travel packages and associated spending and use of motor coach/other guided tours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source of payment (household, government, private employer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demographics of adults that took or did not take trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;travel party composition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three files for this survey - Trip File, Visit File, and Person File.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TSRC is an independant supplemnet to the Labour Force Survey (LFS).&lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>This survey of 12th-grade students is part of a series that
explores changes in important values, behaviors, and lifestyle
orientations of contemporary American youth. Students are randomly
assigned to complete one of six questionnaires, each with a different
subset of topical questions, but all containing a set of "core"
questions on demographics and drug use. There are about 1,400
variables across the questionnaires. Drugs covered by this survey
include tobacco, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, hashish,
prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, LSD,
hallucinogens, amphetamines (stimulants), Ritalin (methylphenidate),
Quaaludes (methaqualone), barbiturates (tranquilizers), cocaine, crack
cocaine, GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate), ecstasy, methamphetamine, and
heroin. Other topics include attitudes toward religion, changing roles
for women, educational aspirations, self-esteem, exposure to drug
education, and violence and crime (both in and out of school).</abstract>

      <abstract>
The Absence from Work Survey was designed primarily to fulfill the objectives of Human Resources Development Canada. They sponsor the qualified wage loss replacement plan which applies to employers who have their own private plans to cover employee wages lost due to sickness, accident, etc. Employers who fall under the plan are granted a reduction in their quotas payable to the Unemployment Insurance Commission. The data generated from the responses to the supplement will provide input to determine the rates for quota reductions for qualified employers. Although the Absence from Work Survey collects information on absences from work due to illness, accident or pregnancy, it does not provide a complete picture of people who have been absent from work for these reasons because the concepts and definitions have been developed specifically for the needs of the client. Absences in this survey are defined as being at least two weeks in length, and respondents are only asked the three reasons for their most recent absence and the one preceding it.
&lt;br&gt;
The Absence From Work Survey, 1981, was conducted in 1980, that is, the Reference Year is 1980.

      <abstract source="producer">The data contain records of sentenced offenders in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) at year-end of fiscal year 1996. The data include commitments of United States District Court, violators of conditions of release (e.g., parole, probation, or supervised release violators), offenders convicted in other courts (e.g., military or District of Columbia courts), and persons admitted to prison as material witnesses or for purposes of treatment, examination, or transfer to another authority. These data include variables that describe the offender, such as age, race, citizenship, as well as variables that describe the sentences and expected prison terms. The data file contains original variables from the Bureau of Prisons' SENTRY database, as well as "SAF" variables that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 7.9-7.16. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.</abstract>

      <abstract>
The Canadian Community Health Survey - Healthy Aging is part of the Canadian Community Health Survey program, but is a unique survey in that the target population, objectives, and many of the questions differ from those of earlier surveys administered under the umbrella of CCHS. The survey collects new information about the factors, influences and processes that contribute to healthy aging through a multidisciplinary approach focusing on health, social and economic determinants. The survey focuses on the health of Canadians aged 45 and over by examining the various factors that impact healthy aging, such as general health and well-being, physical activity, use of health care services, social participation, as well as work and retirement transitions.

Policy makers, researchers and planners are aware that planning for the future of an aging population is an important activity now and in the coming years. This survey will help them make informed decisions regarding health care, social services and income support programs that will affect all Canadians. 

The specific objectives of the survey are: 

1. To better understand the aging process of people aged 45 and over by collecting data on various aspects of their health and well being, use of health care services, social support and participation and work and retirement transitions. 

2. To examine how lifestyle determinants affect health as people age.

3. To examine the links among healthy aging and social, demographic, geographic and economic variables or characteristics using a multidisciplinary approach.

4. To provide information on successful aging by age group and sex.

Data users will include Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, provincial ministries and departments of health, the Institut de la statistique du Québec, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, Human Resources and Social Development Canada, and academic researchers in a variety of disciplines such as gerontology and public health.

      <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a household survey carried out monthly by Statistics Canada. Since its inception in 1945, the objectives of the LFS have been to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications -employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these categories. Data from the survey provide information on major labour market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors&#13;
, hours worked, labour force participation and unemployment rates, employment including the self-employed, full and part-time employment, and unemployment. It publishes monthly standard labour market indicators such as the unemployment rate, the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS is a major source of information on the personal characteristics of the working-age population, including age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Employment estimates include detailed breakdowns by demographic characteristics, industry and occupation,job tenure, and usual and actual hours worked. This dataset is designed to provide the user with historical information from the Labour Force Survey. The tables included are monthly and annual, with some dating back to 1976. Most tables are available by province as well as nationally. Demographic, industry, occupation and other indicators are presented in tables derived from the LFS data. The information generated by the survey has expanded considerably over the years with a major redesign of the survey content in 1976 and again in 1997, and provides a rich and detailed picture of the Canadian labour market.&#13;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some changes to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) were introduced which affect data back to 1987. There are three reasons for this revision:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;The revision enables the use of improved population benchmarks in the LFS estimation process. These improved benchmarks provide better information on the number of non-permanent residents.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There are changes to the data for the public and private sectors from 1987 to 1999. In the past, the data on the public and private sectors for&#13;
this period were based on an old definition of the public sector. The revised data better reflects the current public sector definition, and therefore result in a longer time series for analysis.&#13;
&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The geographic coding of several small Census Agglomerations (CA) has been updated historically from 1996 urban centre boundaries to 2001 CA boundaries. This affects data from January 1987 to December 2004. It is important to note that the changes to almost all estimates are very minor, with the exception of the public sector series and some associated industries from 1987 to 1999. Rates of unemployment, employment and participation are essentially unchanged, as are all key labour mark&#13;
et trends. The article titled Improvements in 2006 to the LFS (also under the LFS Documentation button) provides an overview of the effect of these changes on the estimates.&#13;
&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;The seasonally-adjusted tables have been revised back three years (beginning with January 2004) based on the latest seasonal output.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This data collection provides comparable measures of state
appellate and trial court caseloads by type of case for the 50 states,
the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Court caseloads are
tabulated according to generic reporting categories developed by the
Court Statistics Project Committee of the Conference of State Court
Administrators. These categories describe differences in the unit of
count and the point of count when compiling each court's caseload.
Major areas of investigation include (1) case filings in state
appellate and trial courts, (2) case processing and dispositions in
state appellate and trial courts, and (3) appellate opinions. Within
each of these areas of state government investigation, cases are
separated by main case type, including civil cases, capital punishment
cases, other criminal cases, juvenile cases, and administrative agency
appeals.</abstract>

&lt;h3&gt;File naming convention&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
Each RAVDESS file has a unique filename. The filename consists of a 7-part numerical identifier (e.g., 02-01-06-01-02-01-12.mp4). These identifiers define the stimulus characteristics:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;strong&gt;Filename identifiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song).&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Statement (01 = "Kids are talking by the door", 02 = "Dogs are sitting by the door").&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <abstract source="producer">Founded in 1999, the Center for Homicide Research has made it its mission to increase case solvability and decrease the occurrence of homicide incidents. In working toward this goal, the Center has put together various databases of national homicide incidents. The Church Shooting Database uses online newspaper archive articles to document all cases of shootings on church property within the United States from 1980-2005. While extensive studies have been done exploring the details of other public shootings such as school campuses and workplaces, the phenomenon of shootings in churches has been left relatively untouched. Taking into account variables about the offenders, victims, and circumstances of each shooting, the database attempts to describe each incident as well as explore how the church context may play a role in the shooting.</abstract>

      <abstract>This data supports a meta-analysis investigating ecological impacts of intense lawn management (mowing). Raw data on invertebrate abundance and temperature data was collected by Léonie Carignan-Guillemette (2018) and Caroline Turcotte (2017) under the supervision of Raphaël Proulx and Vincent Maire (refer to Appendix S1 within related publication for more information). &#13;
&#13;
Other data was gathered and processed according to the following:&#13;
&#13;
We searched the Scopus database on 8 February, 2019 with the following combinations of keywords: (lawn OR turf) AND mowing AND (urban OR city).&#13;
Generally, studies were ineligible when: full-text of the article was not available even after contacting the authors; mowing was incidental to the study and not an experimental factor; response variables were not ecologically relevant; confounding factors (e.g. fertilisation) could not be isolated; a non-urban context was used; or simulated data were presented.&#13;
&#13;
We extracted the mean and statistical variation (standard deviation or standard error) for each response variable in control (less-intensively mown) and treatment (intensively mown) groups. Reported data were used when available. Otherwise, data were extracted from published figures using the Web Plot Digitizer tool. Where summary data on median, and interquartile range was presented, mean and standard deviation was estimated. Variables with multi-temporal data (e.g. soil moisture) were summarised using the mean and pooled standard deviation to provide an aggregated value per site per year. Where seasonal trends were evident in raw multi-temporal data (e.g. soil temperature), data was detrended using a polynomial function and analysis applied to the residuals.</abstract>

      <abstract>This dataset comprises the second follow-up of the baseline
Hispanic EPESE, HISPANIC ESTABLISHED POPULATIONS FOR THE EPIDEMIOLOGIC
STUDIES OF THE ELDERLY, 1993-1994: [ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, NEW
MEXICO, AND TEXAS] (ICPSR 2851), and provides information on 1,980 of
the original respondents. The Hispanic EPESE collected data on a
representative sample of community-dwelling Mexican-American elderly,
aged 65 years and older, residing in the five southwestern states of
Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The primary
purpose of the series was to provide estimates of the prevalence of
key physical health conditions, mental health conditions, and
functional impairments in older Mexican Americans and to compare these
estimates with those for other populations. The Hispanic EPESE
attempted to determine whether certain risk factors for mortality and
morbidity operate differently in Mexican Americans than in
non-Hispanic White Americans, African Americans, and other major
ethnic groups. The public-use data cover background characteristics
(age, sex, type of Hispanic race, income, education, marital status,
number of children, employment, and religion), height, weight, social
and physical functioning, chronic conditions, related health problems,
health habits, self-reported use of dental, hospital, and nursing home
services, and depression. The follow-ups provide a cross-sectional
examination of the predictors of mortality, changes in health
outcomes, and institutionalization and other changes in living
arrangements, as well as changes in life situations and quality of
life issues. The vital status of respondents from baseline to this
round of the survey may be determined using the Vital Status file
(Part 2). This file contains interview dates from the baseline as well
as vital status at Wave III (respondent survived, date of death if
deceased, proxy-assisted, proxy-true). The first follow-up of the
baseline data (Hispanic EPESE Wave II, 1995-1996 [ICPSR 3385])

      <abstract>
Cet aperçu de l'Enquête sur la dynamique du travail et du revenu (EDTR) donne de l'information sur le but, le contenu, la méthodologie et les produits et services liés à l'EDTR. Son logiciel HTML à base de menus permet à l'utilisateur de découvrir tous les éléments principaux de l'enquête dans un même document facile d'utilisation. Cette publication a été conçue pour les répondants de l'enquête, les utilisateurs de données de l'EDTR, les chercheurs et les analystes, et les personnes qui voudraient en apprendre davantage sur l'enquête.


L'EDTR constitue une source importante de données sur le revenu des familles, des ménages et des personnes canadiennes. Depuis 1993, l'EDTR (comparativement aux enquêtes traditionnelles traitant de l'activité sur le marché du travail et du revenu) fournit une dimension de plus : les changements touchant des personnes ou des familles à travers le temps. Parmi les objectifs visés par l'enquête, on trouve le désir de comprendre le bien-être économique des Canadiens. L'EDTR fournit également des renseignements sur une vaste série de variables de capital humain, d'expériences liées au travail et de caractéristiques démographiques comme l'éducation, les liens entre les membres de la famille et la composition du ménage. Son contenu élargi, combiné à un échantillon relativement grand, en fait un ensemble de données unique et fort appréciable.

      <abstract source="producer">The data contain records of arrests and bookings for federal offenses in the United States during fiscal year 2006. The data were constructed from the United States Marshals Service (USMS) Prisoner Tracking System database. Records include arrests made by federal law enforcement agencies (including the USMS), state and local agencies, and self-surrenders. Offenders arrested for federal offenses are transferred to the custody of the USMS for processing, transportation, and detention. The Prisoner Tracking System contains data on all offenders within the custody of the USMS. The data file contains variables from the original USMS files as well as additional analysis variables, or "SAF" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 1.1-1.3. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.</abstract>

      <abstract>
The objective of the Survey of Job Opportunities is to identify "discouraged seekers" and profile their characteristics. More specifically, the survey's purpose is to collect information on persons who are currently not employed and have not been actively looking for work in the past four weeks.
&lt;br&gt;
In may parts of Canada, potential workers have a detailed knowledge of the annual hiring patterns of employers, and employers rely on the participation patterns of the work force. In these situations there is little, if any, job search activity by potential workers and minimal recruitment activity by emploeyrs. Since potential employers know the approximate dates, much of the hiring activity takes place by direct contact between employee and emploeyr
&lt;br&gt;
Since 1979 Statistics Canada has conducted an annual survey, sponsored by Employment and Immigration Canada, to consider and evaluate this theory. The survey is conducted in March of each year, and asks questions about job opportunities from the previous calendar year. The questionnaire has remained largely unchaged resulting in a wealth of data covering 14 years.

      <abstract date="2017-03">Protein interactions shape proteome function and thus biology. Identification of protein interactions is a major goal in molecular biology, but biochemical methods, although improving, remain limited in coverage and accuracy. Whereas computational predictions can guide biochemical experiments, low validation rates of  predictions remain a major limitation. Here, we investigated computational methods in the prediction of a specific type of interaction, the inhibitory interactions between proteases and their inhibitors. Proteases generate thousands of proteoforms that dynamically shape the functional state of proteomes. Despite the important regulatory role of proteases, knowledge of their inhibitors remains largely incomplete with the vast majority of proteases lacking an annotated inhibitor. To link inhibitors to their target proteases on a large scale, we applied computational methods to predict inhibitory interactions between proteases and their inhibitors based on complementary data including coexpression, phylogenetic similarity, structural information, co-annotation, and colocalization, and also surveyed general protein interaction networks for potential inhibitory interactions. In testing nine predicted interactions biochemically, we validated the inhibition of kallikrein 5 by serpin B12. Despite the use of a wide array of complementary data, we found a high false positive rate of computational predictions in biochemical follow-up. Based on a protease-specific definition of true negatives derived from the biochemical classification of proteases and inhibitors, we analyzed prediction accuracy of individual features. Thereby we identified feature-specific limitations, which also affected general protein interaction prediction methods. Interestingly, proteases were often not coexpressed with most of their functional inhibitors, contrary to what is commonly assumed and extrapolated predominantly from cell culture experiments. Predictions of inhibitory interactions were indeed more challenging than predictions of non-proteolytic and non-inhibitory interactions. In summary, we describe a novel and well-defined but difficult protein interaction prediction task, and thereby highlight limitations of computational interaction prediction methods.</abstract>

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The "Sysmiss" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the "Valid" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LFS revisions: 
LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. &lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract>These data provide information on the population and
characteristics of public and private juvenile facilities in operation
in the United States on February 15, 1989. Annual data for the 1988
calendar year are included as well. Questions designed to categorize
each facility were asked concerning the number of adults held, the
juvenile majority's custodial authority, reason for custody, and
access to the community, as well as the facility's security
arrangements, capacity, age, plans for renovation, type of
administration, and setting. Extensive data on the total juvenile
residential population of each facility was also gathered. The total
population is broken down by admission type, legal status, type of
offense, race, and age. The collection also contains information on
the population's movement and average length of stay, as well as each
facility's average daily population, number and types of personnel,
educational, treatment, and medical programs available, annual
expenditures, court orders and consent decrees, number of juvenile
deaths that year, and availability of juvenile records.</abstract>

      <abstract>
The International Travel Survey (ITS) is an ongoing survey conducted by Statistics Canada since the 1920s to
meet the requirements of the Canadian System of National Accounts (Balance of Payments (BOP)). Through
the years, the need for detailed characteristics of travellers for market research and industry planning was
gradually incorporated in the survey. Today, the ITS provides a full range of statistics on the volume of
international travellers and detailed characteristics of their trips such as expenditures, activities, places visited
and length of stay.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The ITS covers both Canadian residents returning from trips outside Canada and international visitors to
Canada. In addition to fulfilling BOP requirements, the ITS is also being used by the Tourism Satellite
Account (TSA), Customs Canada, the Canadian tourism Commission (CTC), provincial tourism agencies, the
United States Department of Commerce and a number of private sector industries. The ITS is also used for
reporting to international organizations such as the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Pacific-Asia Tourism Association.

the World Military Expenditures data series. Data are provided on the
international and domestic conflict behavior and national attributes
of 85 developing nations (as defined by the United States Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency) in the period 1962-1967. Included are data on
cooperative and conflict events received and sent, various socioeconomic
indicators (all for mid-1960s), and various yearly domestic conflict data
aggregated to the period 1962-1964 and 1965-1967. Yearly frequencies for
each type were aggregated into three-year scores. Domestic conflict
behavior variables measure the occurrences of riots, armed attacks,
demonstrations, government sanctions and executions, assassinations,
irregular power transfers, political strikes, interventions, and deaths
from domestic violence. Socioeconomic variables itemize gross national
product (GNP), military, educational, and health expenditures, United
States' economic aid per capita, population growth rates, energy
consumption per capita, literacy rates, and ethno-linguistic
fractionalization.</abstract>

      <abstract>
&lt;p&gt;The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy. With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The "Sysmiss" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the "Valid" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LFS revisions: 
LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. &lt;/p&gt;

      <abstract source="producer">These surveys were undertaken to measure changes in consumer 
 attitudes and expectations, to understand why these changes occur, and 
 to evaluate how they relate to consumer decisions to save, borrow, or 
 make discretionary purchases. This type of information is essential for 
 forecasting changes in aggregate consumer behavior. Since the late 
 1940s, these surveys have been produced quarterly through 1977 and 
 monthly thereafter. Each monthly survey contains approximately 40-50 
 questions and probes a different aspect of consumer confidence. 
 Open-ended questions are asked concerning evaluations and expectations 
 about personal finances, employment, price changes, and the national 
 business situation. Additional questions probe buying intentions for 
 automobiles and the respondent's appraisals of present market 
conditions for purchasing houses, automobiles, and other durables.</abstract>

      <abstract source="producer">This special topic poll is part of a continuing series of monthly surveys that solicits public opinion on the presidency and on a range of other political and social issues. This data collection polled respondents on their opinions before and after the 2008 presidential election held on November 4, 2008. In the original poll, fielded October 30-November 3, 2008, respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling the presidency, whether their family was financially better off compared to four years ago, and whether a person's race affected their chances of getting ahead in today's society. Those who were registered to vote were asked about how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign, their opinions of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates, whether they had voted in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus that year, the likelihood that they would vote in the general election and for whom, and whether they planned to vote in person on election day, by mail or absentee ballot, or at an early voting location. Other questions addressed respondent's willingness to participate in an exit poll or post-election telephone survey. After the election, 1,220 adults were re-interviewed in a call-back poll conducted November 7-10, 2008. Respondents who had voted were asked who they had voted for, when they had finally decided on a candidate, the main reason they chose that candidate, which voting method they used, how long they had waited in line to vote, and whether they were contacted by a presidential campaign. Those who did not vote were asked about the main reason they did not vote. All respondents in the call-back poll were asked whether progress had been made against racial discrimination since the 1960s, whether they were pleased with the outcome of the election, and their views on the upcoming Obama presidency. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, marital status, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, length of time at current residence, military service, religious preference, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian.</abstract>

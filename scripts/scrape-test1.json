This data collection focused on the presidential election that\n took place on November 7, 2000. Respondents were asked about the\n extent of their personal interest in and concern about the situation\n in the country five days after the election. Questions examined\n opinions on the way various groups were handling the election,\n including Vice President Al Gore's and Texas governor George W. Bush's\n campaigns, local officials in Florida, and the news media. Respondents\n were also asked whom they wanted to see become the next\n president. Opinions were elicited on the need for a new presidential\n election in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the entire state of\n Florida, in other states where election results were very close, and\n across the entire country. Additional topics covered whether George\n W. Bush and Al Gore should accept the recount in Florida or should ask\n courts to look into whether the voting was unfair and if they should ask\n for a recount in other states where the results were very close. Those\n polled expressed their views about electing the president by direct\n popular vote versus by the Electoral College, their confidence about\n the accuracy of Florida's recount, and whether the ballot that was\n used in Palm Beach County was fair. The survey also investigated what\n impact the unclear post-election situation would have, especially on\n the country's system of presidential elections. Background information\n on respondents includes age, gender, education, race, party\naffiliation, political orientation, and voter registration.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"ABC News.

For the first major area of focus, poverty and social exclusion, the survey queried respondents about their own definition of poverty, the extent of poverty and homelessness in their area, and whether or not respondents believed poverty had increased in their area and elsewhere. Respondents were queried about what necessities people must be able to afford to meet a minimal acceptable living standard, who is most at risk for poverty, as well as the social, political, and personal causes of poverty and homelessness. Respondents were also asked about how poverty impacts peoples’ chances of completing certain activities, such as getting a good education or finding a job. Respondents were then asked whether or not they trust the European Union (EU), their governments, charities, other citizens, and miscellaneous institutions to effectively respond to poverty. Respondents were also asked to whom they assign primary responsibility for reducing or preventing poverty, what policies their governments should focus on in the future in the effort to help people out of poverty, and whether or not respondents approved of their government’s existing anti-poverty measures. Respondents were also queried about their perception of social tensions between groups, and about what they have done personally to help poor people. Additionally, respondents were queried about their own living conditions, satisfaction with life, ability to keep a job, efforts to fight poverty, finances, and their own risk of falling into poverty. For the second major area of focus, mobile phone use, the survey asked respondents about whether or not they owned a mobile phone, their mobile phone use in other EU countries, and the cost of cellular phone service in those countries. For the third major area of focus, economic crisis, the survey questioned respondents about the degree to which the crisis personally affected them, how the crisis affected the EU and its policy efforts, who should bear responsibility for the crisis, who should bear the burden of response to the crisis, and how the European Parliament and other bodies should respond to the crisis. For the fourth major area of focus, international trade, the survey queried respondents on whether they pay attention to the country of origin for products they purchase, how trade impacts respondents and their countries, what European Union trade policy should be going into the future, and the European Union’s international economic standing. Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, nationality, marital status and parental relations, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other durable goods, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, and Internet use.

Another major focus of the surveys was to ask respondents to express their opinion in regard to the European Constitution, including its adoption and ratification. Respondents also were asked about EU enlargement including whom they would favor to join the EU, the political, social, and economic effects of enlargement, and initiatives for the success of further EU enlargement. In addition, respondents were asked questions about exports versus imports and migration among the EU's old and new member states, the accession of Western Balkan countries and Turkey, and  financial assistance available to EU member and candidate countries. Special topics included quality of life, avian influenza, and energy issues. For the first special topic, quality of life, the survey asked respondents to evaluate the economic, social, and environmental situation among several domains, in addition to their personal financial status and quality of life, and to identify priorities for the improvement of the EU economy. For the next special topic, respondents were queried about avian influenza, its transmission,  regulations preventing its spread, their behavior in consuming poultry and eggs, dissemination of health information, and public safety. For the final special topic, respondents answered questions about their usage of energy and how the EU citizens and government could reduce energy consumption and utilize alternative resources. Demographic and other background information includes age, gender, nationality, birthplace, marital status, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age at completion of full-time education, household composition, religious affiliation and involvement, and ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other durable goods.

Elle mesure l'ampleur des voyages intérieurs au Canada, du point de vue de la demande. L'enquête vise à recueillir de l'information sur le volume de voyages et des dépenses des résidents du Canada selon l'origine du voyage, la destination, la durée, le type d'hébergement utilisé, le but du voyage, le moyen de transport, etc., à recueillir de l'information sur l'incidence des voyages et fournir le profil sociodémographique des voyageurs et des non-voyageurs. Les estimations permettent d'effectuer des analyses sur une base trimestrielle à l'échelle nationale, provinciale et régionale (à divers degrés de précision) concernant les informations suivantes :\n<ul>\n\n<li> nombre total de voyages d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus effectués par les résidents du Canada et dont la destination était au Canada;</li>\n<li> visites d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus au Canada;</li>\n<li> raison principale du voyage et activités principales effectuées pendant le voyage;</li>\n<li> dépenses effectuées pour les voyages d'un même jour et d'une nuit ou plus au Canada par les résidents du Canada, au total et selon la catégorie de dépenses;</li>\n<li> moyens de transport utilisés pendant le voyage (principal/autre);</li>\n<li> visites-personnes, visites-ménages, dépenses totales et par catégorie de dépenses pour chaque endroit visité au Canada;</li>\n<li> nuitées-personnes et nuitées-ménages passées à chaque endroit visité au Canada, au total et selon le type d'hébergement utilisé;</li>\n<li> utilisation de forfaits de voyage et dépenses qui y sont associées et participation à des excursions guidées en autocar/autre;</li>\n<li> personne ou organisme ayant payé les coûts du voyage (ménage, gouvernement, employeur privé);</li>\n<li> caractéristiques démographiques des adultes qui ont effectué des voyages et ceux qui n'en n'ont pas effectués;</li>\n<li> composition du groupe des voyageurs.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Les utilisateurs principaux des données de l'EVRC sont Statistique Canada, la Commission canadienne du tourisme, les provinces et les bureaux de tourisme.

As part of adapting to life in Canada, many immigrants face challenges such as finding suitable accommodation, learning or becoming more fluent in one or both of Canada's official languages, participating in the labour market or accessing education and training opportunities. The results of this survey will provide indicators of how immigrants are meeting these and other challenges. While integration may take many years, the LSIC is designed to examine the first four years of settlement, a time when newcomers establish economic, social and cultural ties to Canadian society. To this end, the objectives of the survey are two-fold: to study how new immigrants adjust to life in Canada over time; and, to provide information on the factors that can facilitate or hinder this adjustment.\n\nTopics covered in the survey include language proficiency, housing, education, foreign credential recognition, employment, health, values and attitudes, the development and use of social networks, income, and perceptions of settlement in Canada. \n\nSince immigration is a shared jurisdiction between national and provincial departments the information gathered through the LSIC will be beneficial to many groups including both federal and provincial government departments, immigrant settlement agencies, non-governmental organizations and researchers. Survey results will also play an important role in planning and developing programs that will assist future immigrants settling in Canada.\n\nNote that a public use microdata file will not be created for this survey.

The data were designed to be used\n for multivariate analysis of the factors influencing changes in\n employment status, job mobility of various types, changes in marital\n status, fertility, and residential mobility in Russia during the\n period of 1985-2001. Since the period covered by the histories spans\n the final seven years of the Soviet era and the first decade of the\n post-Soviet era, the data are uniquely suited for assessing whether\n the transition from Soviet-style socialism has affected\n stratification, family formation, and migration processes. Moreover,\n because the data include work/employment, family structure, and\n migration histories, the dataset is uniquely suited for dynamic\n analyses of the inter-relationships among states and events in these\n three domains. Finally, because the data contain information on each\n respondent's oblast (region) of residence at all points in time from\n 1985-2001, data on regional characteristics can be merged with files\n created from the survey data, in order to measure the impact of\n regional characteristics on individual-level events.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. </p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 1995.

They were\n composed of geographically contiguous census tracts and geographic\n boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered\n in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately\n 8,000 people.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample\n of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21\n strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with\n the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to\n eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic\n status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected\n at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing\n of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.\n Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts\n (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through\n in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the\n 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within\n six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were\n selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of\n 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the\n eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.\n For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the\n child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to\n spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research\n assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews\n were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete\n protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was\n hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,\n Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,\n participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other\n incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly\n drawing prizes were also included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n Employment and Income Interview\n The Employment and Income Interview was completed by primary\n caregivers (Cohorts 0 to 15) and subjects (Cohort 18). The interview\n contained questions regarding the employment status and income earned\n by the respondents in order to give an overview of the economic\n conditions under which the Longitudinal Cohort Study participants\n lived. Each respondent was asked to respond to questions concerning\n the details of his or her partner's employment and salary to give a\n complete summary of the household's economic situation. The response\n format for the Employment and Income Interview varied from question to\n question. Some questions were petitioned straightforward, yes or no\n responses. Other questions offered multiple choices of which the\n respondent was permitted to select the one response which best\n described their situation.

The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also administered in June 2001 (ICPSR 4043) and November 2001 (ICPSR 4044). These three supplements comprise the 2001-2002 waves of TUS data.The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS monthly items were eligible for the TUS, which consisted of items PES32 through PES77.  The TUS was mainly designed to be a proxy response survey, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent questions. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for questions on the topics of smoking status (items PES32-PES34) and the use of other tobacco products; for example, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PES62A-PES63B).Additionally, self-respondents were asked various questions depending on their smoking status -- former, everyday, or occasional (items PES36-PES46 and PES55-PES61). Current everyday and occasional smokers were then asked whether the medical community had advised them to quit smoking or if they were planning to quit in the near future (items PES47-PES54). Self-respondents were further queried on smoking policies in their work place (items PES67-PES71), smoking rules in the home (item PES73) and questions on opinions about smoking (items PES72, PES75-PES77).Administrative information was collected on who the proxy respondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected includes age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States.

In healthy individuals, unimanual movement (with either the left or right hand) is associated with activity in a network of predominantly contralateral brain regions, including the primary motor cortex. This laterality is often compromised following a middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Neuroimaging studies of these patients have shown that unimanual movements with the effected hand are associated with elevated blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in both the lesioned and the nonlesioned primary motor cortices. Elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is well-established in chronic stroke patients and is associated with poor motor rehabilitation outcomes. Yet the neurobiologic basis for this aberrant neural activity is equivocal.\nOne factor that may contribute to elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is increased cortical excitatory tone within the contralesional hemisphere. While approximately 80% of the descending corticospinal neurons that control the right hand originate in the left PMC, 20% originate in the right PMC. Elevated activity in the right PMC of left-sided stroke patients may reflect compensatory activity of these descending fibers. Neural activity in the PMC reflects the balance of local excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) processing. It can be measured in two manners: electrophysiologically, using single hemisphere paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and neurochemically, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\nAnother factor that may contribute to elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is a loss of transcallosal inhibition between the hemispheres. During right hand movement, the left PMC of healthy individuals actively inhibits the right PMC via inhibitory projections through the corpus callosum. In left MCA stroke patients, elevated activity in the contralesional (right) PMC when moving the right hand may reflect a loss of typical inhibition from the left PMC. The integrity of inter-hemispheric information transfer can be measured in two manners: using bi-hemispheric paired-pulse TMS, and using a multimodal brain stimulation/brain imaging approach, interleaved TMS/MRI. Through interleaved TMS/MRI, researchers can selectively stimulate the ipsilesional PMC and quantify the amount of TMS-induced activity in the contralesional PMC.\nThese two explanations were tested through a cross-sectional investigation of neural function in left MCA stroke patients with mild-moderate right upper extremity impairment and controls matched for age and cardiovascular risk factors. To assess the clinical relevance of these factors on motor dysfunction, the researchers performed a detailed kinematic assessment of movement efficiency, smoothness and compensation.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The specific aims of this study are: to quantify the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory tone within the contralesional PMC, to quantify the level of information flow between the left and right PMC, and to quantify the relationship between neural activity and performance. The results of these aims will clarify the relative contribution of within and between hemisphere adaptations to cortical reorganization. These cross-sectional data will also be the foundation of a longitudinal R01 that will determine which patterns of laterality predict favorable treatment outcomes.

Individuals were pre-screened for eligibility on the phone by a clinical research assistant with experience working with stroke patients for research studies.

Participants performed a comprehensive assessment of motor function utilizing the resources and staff of the Quantitative Behavioral Assessment and Rehabilitation (QBAR) Core. Specifically, all stroke patients completed the Rasch modified version of the Fugl-Meyer Motor assessment battery and a kinematic assessment of both unimanual and bimanual movements using a 45 sensor 3D optical imaging system.

Teachers, administrators, and staff who agreed to participate in the study were enrolled in the iris technology system and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The treatment group was allowed access to all doors. Parents who agreed to participate were also randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Parents in the treatment group could use the front entrance of the elementary school and would be able to check out their children during school hours by using the iris scanner rather than showing identification and writing out the names of their children on a log sheet. The first wave of teacher and parent surveys were conducted about one month before the iris scanning technology was installed and wave two surveys were conducted near the end of the school year. The first teacher survey was conducted in March 2003 in the Middle School and the Elementary School during an all-staff meeting prior to the school day. Teachers and staff took approximately 10-15 minutes to complete the survey while the research staff waited. School staff who could not attend the meeting or who had to leave early returned the surveys to the secretary for the Assistant Superintendent, who forwarded them to the researchers by mail. In the High School, research staff approached the teachers and staff individually during the school study hall, the teacher's break, and the lunch hours. School secretaries collected extra surveys left for teachers and staff missed due to absences. In June 2003, near the end of the school year, research staff returned and repeated the respective process to administer the second survey to the teachers and staff in the three schools.

Respondents were also asked if they had used T-PASS to sign a child out of the school, the ease of use of using T-PASS to sign-out a child, the security level of using T-PASS to sign-out a child, and problems they experienced using T-PASS to sign a child out of the school. Dataset 6, the first teacher survey, includes demographic variables such as gender, race, year born, current position, highest level of education, years working in Plumsted Township schools and if less than five years where previously worked. Respondents were asked which school they worked in and if the school had problems with issues such as fighting, absenteeism, tardiness, bullying, theft, vandalism, drug, alcohol or tobacco use by students, and possession of weapons by students. Respondents were asked if they felt safe at the school and in the surrounding neighborhood and if they thought the children felt safe at the school and in surrounding neighborhood. Respondents were asked how many times per day they left the school during school hours, the reason for leaving and if they used a swipe card to enter the building. Variables were also included to gauge the respondents' use of technologies such as cell phones, voice-mail, and computers.  Finally, the respondents were asked how they learned of the iris recognition system (T-PASS) being implemented at the schools.The second teacher survey, Dataset 7, includes the same variables as Dataset 6, but has additional variables related to the respondents' use of T-PASS and the buzzer system. Respondents were asked if they had used T-PASS, to compare T-PASS to the buzzer and the swipe card systems in terms of ease of use and level of security provided, and if they had experienced any problems using T-PASS. Respondents were also asked if they had used the buzzer system to enter the school, to compare the buzzer system to T-PASS in terms of ease of use and level of security provided, and if they had any problems while trying to use the buzzer system. Finally, respondents were asked if they had gained entry into the school through other means, and to describe the other means of entry used.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Uchida, Craig D., Edward R.

This project was developed with the understanding that prevention and early intervention services for disordered gambling could be better informed by a rigorous longitudinal study of the natural progression of gambling in the general population.</p>\r\n<p>In order to examine the determinants and the course of both non-problematic gambling and problem gambling, the LLLP surveys collected data on a number of gambling-specific and general aspects of the responders' lives. The LLLP contains data relating to gambling-specific information, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>demographics;</li>\r\n<li>past year and lifetime gambling behaviour;</li>\r\n<li>gambling attitudes and beliefs in gambling fallacies;</li>\r\n<li>motivations for gambling;</li>\r\n<li>stigma experienced from gambling; and</li>\r\n<li>family history of gambling.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition to gambling-specific data, the LLLP survey contains a number of general data variables, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>general/physical health;</li>\r\n<li>psychological factors (personality and temperament, psychopathology, coping strategies);</li>\r\n<li>comorbid factors (ADHD, eating disorders, substance use disorders);</li>\r\n<li>cultural factors (religiosity) and;</li>\r\n<li>social factors (social support/networks, non-gambling activity participation).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A sample of 1,808 participants was recruited from four diverse regions of Alberta: Edmonton, Calgary, Lethbridge, and Grand Prairie.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. </p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 2009.

They were\n composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic\n boundaries and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered in\n the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately\n 8,000 people.\n Longitudinal Cohort Study\n For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample\n of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21\n strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with\n the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to\n eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic\n status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected\n at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing\n of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.\n Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts\n (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through\n in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the\n 80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within\n six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were\n selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of\n 8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the\n eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.\n For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the\n child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to\n spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research\n assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews\n were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete\n protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was\n hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,\n Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,\n participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other\n incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly\n drawing prizes were also included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n Family Mental Health and Legal History\n Administered between 1994 and 1997, the Family Mental Health and\n Legal History instrument was completed by primary caregivers of\n subjects belonging to Cohorts 0 to 18 of the PHDCN Longitudinal Cohort\n Study. Respondents answered either \"Yes\" or \"No\" to questions\n inquiring about the family's history with alcohol and drug abuse,\n depression, nervous breakdowns, suicide, frequent fighting, trouble\n keeping a job, and frequent discipline problems. For each \"Yes\"\n response, respondents also provided the family member's relation to\n the subject (e.g., biological, nonbiological, maternal, paternal, or\n parent, sibling, aunt, uncle, grandparent, or other). Up to 15 family\n members could have been mentioned for each question asked. The\n instrument was also used to gather information on treatment and\n hospitalization for substance abuse or emotional problems. For those\n family members mentioned as having a history of mental health issues,\n questions were asked concerning any trouble they may have had with the\n police, if they had ever been arrested, and whether they were serving\nany time in a jail or prison.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"In addition to the variables containing the\n responses to the Family Mental Health and Legal History instrument,\n the data contain administrative variables that record identification\n numbers for respondents and interviewers, cohort, and wave number, as\nwell as the time and date each interview was completed.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Earls, Felton J., Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, Stephen W.

Bush was handling the presidency and the economy, the most important problem facing the nation, and how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign. Several questions addressed the economy and sought opinions on the condition of the national economy, the most important economic problem facing the nation, whether the United States was in an economic recession and whether the economy was getting better or worse. Registered voters were asked whether they were more likely to vote in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus, which candidate they supported and why, who they expected to win the Democratic nomination, their opinions of the candidates, and for whom they would vote if the election was held that day. Views were also sought on Senator Barack Obama's former minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright's statements and whether his statements affected the respondent's opinions of Obama. Respondents were asked how concerned they were about several aspects of their personal finances including being able to afford health care, housing, and retirement costs, college tuition, and whether they were concerned about their job security. Respondents were also asked about their biggest economic concern, whether they were getting ahead financially, whether they had made cutbacks in their spending, and whether rises in food prices was affecting them. Additional questions asked respondents whether they had any close friends or relatives who filed for bankruptcy or had a foreclosure in the past year, whether they had any money invested in the stock market, and whether they thought investment in the stock market was safe.  Other topics addressed the war in Iraq, the home mortgage crisis, estate and income tax, trade restrictions, and race relations. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, employment status, marital status, whether respondents had children under 18 years of age, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"CBS News, and The New York Times.

SUPPORT comprised a two-year prospective\nobservational study (Phase I) followed by a two-year controlled\nclinical trial (Phase II). Phase I of SUPPORT collected data from\npatients accessioned during 1989-1991 to characterize the care,\ntreatment preferences, and patterns of decision-making among\ncritically ill patients. It also served as a preliminary step for\ndevising an intervention strategy for improving critically-ill\npatients' care and for the construction of statistical models for\npredicting patient prognosis and functional status. An intervention\nwas implemented in Phase II of SUPPORT, which accessioned patients\nduring 1992-1994. The Phase II intervention provided physicians with\naccurate predictive information on future functional ability, survival\nprobability to six months, and patients' preferences for end-of-life\ncare. Additionally, a skilled nurse was provided as part of the\nintervention to elicit patient preferences, provide prognoses, enhance\nunderstanding, enable palliative care, and facilitate advance\nplanning. The intervention was expected to increase communication,\nresulting in earlier decisions to have orders against resuscitation,\ndecrease time that patients spent in undesirable states (e.g., in the\nIntensive Care Unit, on a ventilator, and in a coma), increase\nphysician understanding of patients' preferences for care, decrease\npatient pain, and decrease hospital resource use. Data collection in\nboth phases of SUPPORT consisted of questionnaires administered to\npatients, their surrogates, and physicians, plus chart reviews for\nabstracting clinical, treatment, and decision information. Phase II\nalso collected information regarding the implementation of the\nintervention, such as patient-specific logs maintained by nurses\nassigned to patients as part of the intervention. SUPPORT patients\nwere followed for six months after inclusion in the study. Those who\ndid not die within six months or were lost to follow-up were matched\nagainst the National Death Index to identify deaths through 1997. The\nHELP study was conducted in 1993 concomitantly with Phase II of\nSUPPORT and collected data to characterize the care, treatment\npreferences, and patterns of decision-making among hospitalized\npatients who were at least 80 years old. HELP data were also intended\nfor use in adapting existing mortality and functional status models of\nelderly hospitalized patients. Data collection methods of HELP were\nessentially the same as those of SUPPORT. HELP patients were followed\nfor 12 months after inclusion in the study.

The interview asked specific questions on membership breadth, such as the number of different stakeholder groups that participated in the collaboration; aspects of implementation, such as their use of formal resources and structures to organize their work; and extent to which they institutionalize various collaborative activities into their teamwork in order to promote change. Based on these features, cluster analysis was used to empirically derive patterns of SART implementation.\n\n\nStudy 2 Network Analysis sought to deepen the understanding of how SART structure relates to SART perceived effectiveness by examining the structure of inter-organizational relationships within SARTs. Based on Study 1 results, four model SARTs (high use of formal structures and institutionalization of collaborative activities, and all engaging in program evaluation) were sampled. Phone interviews were conducted with a key informant from each of the members of the SART. Three types of collaborative relationships were assessed: inter-organizational communication about coordinating the response to sexual assault, believing that other organizations value their organizations role in the response to sexual assault, and believing that other organizations are a resource to their organization's work in responding to sexual assault.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates.

Yet, the effects on the well-being of residents of moving out of such communities into less distressed areas remain uncertain. Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is a randomized housing experiment administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that gave low-income families living in high-poverty areas in five cities the chance to move to lower-poverty areas. Families were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) the low-poverty voucher (LPV) group (also called the experimental group) received Section 8 rental assistance certificates or vouchers that they could use only in census tracts with 1990 poverty rates below 10 percent. The families received mobility counseling and help in leasing a new unit. One year after relocating, families could use their voucher to move again if they wished, without any special constraints on location; (2) the traditional voucher (TRV) group (also called the Section 8 group) received regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers that they could use anywhere; these families received no special mobility counseling; (3) the control group received no certificates or vouchers through MTO, but continued to be eligible for project-based housing assistance and whatever other social programs and services to which they would otherwise be entitled. Families were tracked from baseline (1994-1998) through the long-term evaluation survey fielding period (2008-2010) with the purpose of determining the effects of \"neighborhood\" on participating families. This data collection includes data from the 3,273 adult interviews completed as part of the MTO long-term evaluation. Using data from the long-term evaluation, the associated article reports that moving from a high-poverty to lower-poverty neighborhood was associated in the long-term (10 to 15 years) with modest, but potentially important, reductions in the prevalence of extreme obesity and diabetes. The data contain all outcomes and mediators analyzed for the associated article (with the exception of a few mediator variables from the interim MTO evaluation) as well as a variety of demographic and other baseline measures that were controlled for in the analysis.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Ludwig, Jens, Lisa Sanbonmatsu, Lisa A.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nMowers, S. 2009.

The LFS collects monthly information on the labour market activities of Canada's working age population. This product is for users who prefer to do their own analysis by focusing on specific subgroups in the population or by cross-classifying variables that are not in our catalogued products.\n\nThis file contains both personal characteristics for all individuals in the household and detailed labour force characteristics for household members 15 years of age and over. The personal characteristics include age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Detailed labour force characteristics include employment information such as class of worker, usual and actual hours of work, employee hourly and weekly wages, industry and occupation of current or most recent job, public and private sector, union status, paid or unpaid overtime hours, job permanency, hours of work lost, job tenure, and unemployment information such as duration of unemployment, methods of job search and type of job sought. Labour force characteristics are also available for students during the school year and during the summer months as well as school attendance whether full or part-time and the type of institution. These and more are available by province and for the three largest census metropolitan areas (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver).\n\nThis is a monthly file, and is available going back to 1976.\n\nLFS revisions: LFS estimates have been adjusted to reflect population counts based on the 2011 Census and includes updates to 2011 Geography classification system and were revised back to 2001.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nLeahey, A. 2017.

Prior to participation,\n subjects completed a short questionnaire regarding their health\n status, history of lung disease and asthma, smoking history,\n medication use, and respiratory inhaler medication use.

Derived from the extract of the capsicum pepper plant,\n OC spray causes inflammation and edema over areas of contact\n (primarily the face, eyes, nose, and mouth), resulting in pain and\n discomfort such that many suspects lose their capacity to resist. With\n widespread use, however, OC spray as a use-of-force method has been\n alleged in the media to have been associated with a number of\n in-custody deaths. Because symptoms of coughing, gagging, and\n shortness of breath are common with OC exposure, concern has focused\n on the respiratory effects of OC spray as playing a potential role in\n these deaths. Moreover, individuals subdued with OC spray in the field\n often require physical restraint, including the prone maximal\n restraint or hobble position. Some have argued that OC in combination\n with restraint can lead to significant respiratory compromise and risk\n for asphyxiation and death. While capsaicin, the active ingredient of\n OC, has been studied extensively in the medical literature for its\n ability to induce coughing, few studies on the physiologic effects of\n OC on humans have been conducted, particularly relating to respiratory\n function. In addition, no prior studies have been done on the effects\n of OC in combination with positional restraint. The goal of this study\n was to assess the safety of a commercially available OC spray in use\n by law enforcement agencies nationwide. Specifically, the researchers\n examined both OC spray and positional restraint in human subjects to\n determine if OC exposure by itself or in combination with positional\n restraint resulted in clinically significant respiratory compromise as\n measured by pulmonary function testing and assessment of oxygenation\n and ventilation. Additionally, they sought to determine if OC spray by\n itself or in combination with positional restraint resulted in any\n hemodynamic compromise as measured by pulse rate and blood pressure,\n whether body size and weight influenced the effects of OC spray in\n regard to respiratory and pulmonary function, and whether pulmonary\n disease (such as asthma), the use of respiratory inhaler medications,\n or history of smoking tobacco influenced the effects of OC spray in\n regard to respiratory and pulmonary function, with both of the latter\n two measured by pulmonary function testing and assessment of\noxygenation and ventilation.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The study was conducted as a randomized,\n cross-over, controlled trial on volunteer human subjects recruited\n from the local law enforcement training academy in San Diego County,\n California.

Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. \n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée.

Researchers of urban social problems\n continue to struggle with this question.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2010 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States Department of Health and Human Services.

The overall research questions of this study include: (1) how demographic and socioeconomic processes at the household level, e.g. those related to family structures and livelihood systems, affect local residents' resource exploitation patterns and land use practices; (2) how local residents respond to shifts in government policy, especially the implementation of two nationwide conservation programs, the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP), in WNR; and (3) how household and policy dynamics interact to affect the natural environment of WNR. Example hypotheses tested in this study concerned: (1) the effects of conservation policies on local households' energy consumption patterns and fuelwood collection behaviors; (2) the connection between a household's demographic and socioeconomic background and its responses to conservation policies; (3) the relationships between social networks and labor migration; (4) the factors that affect a household's participation in nature-based tourism and the distribution of tourism benefits among different households; and (5) the potential implication of the processes described above on wildlife habitat change and conservation. The data collection in this study focuses on household demographics, household income and expenditure, fuelwood and electricity use, as well as the development of non-agricultural activities such as migration and tourism. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect yearly data of the previous year in 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2010 using highly structured survey questionnaires. A sample of 220 households originally drawn in 1999 was revisited in each year's survey.

Frequencies, crosstabulations, and comparison of means are used for the analyses.","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"crime","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"instructional materials","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"social sciences","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"victimization","metadata-type":"element"},{"accsPlac_URI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3886/victimization","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"prodDate":"Please see full citation.","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"date":"2009","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"TI-facet":"Crime Victimization in the United States: A Data-Driven Learning Guide","metadata-type":"constraint"}]},{"index":130,"uri":"/icpsr/29062.xml","path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook","score":0,"confidence":0,"fitness":0,"href":"/v1/documents?uri=%2Ficpsr%2F29062.xml","mimetype":"application/xml","format":"xml","matches":[{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/titl","match-text":[{"highlight":"Criminal"}," ",{"highlight":"Justice"}," ",{"highlight":"Drug"}," ",{"highlight":"Abuse"}," ",{"highlight":"Treatment"}," ",{"highlight":"Studies"}," (",{"highlight":"CJDATS"},"):  ",{"highlight":"Detention"}," ",{"highlight":"to"}," ",{"highlight":"Community"}," (",{"highlight":"DTC"},"), ",{"highlight":"2006"},"-",{"highlight":"2008"}," [",{"highlight":"United"}," ",{"highlight":"States"},"]"]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/IDNo","match-text":[{"highlight":"29062"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/*:syear","match-text":[{"highlight":"2006"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/*:slang","match-text":[{"highlight":"en"}]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/icpsr/29062.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/prodStmt/producer","match-text":["\n                        ",{"highlight":"Inter"},"-",{"highlight":"university"}," ",{"highlight":"Consortium"}," ",{"highlight":"for"}," ",{"highlight":"Political"}," ",{"highlight":"and"}," ",{"highlight":"Social"}]}],"metadata":[{"abstract":"The Detention to Community (DTC) study addresses several priority areas of the CJDATS collaborative. First, the study will adapt existing science-based interventions in order to develop specialized services that will address drug abuse, delinquency, and sexual risk-taking among juveniles detained in detention facilities. Second, the study proposes to test an innovative, phasic, multiple-systems intervention in which the in-detention work provides a platform for the adolescent's return to the community. This bridge is created by linking the in-detention and outpatient treatment components in ways that reflect the consensus in the literature regarding the need for integrative, comprehensive interventions for criminal justice involved, substance abusing individuals (Cook, 1992; Altschuler and Armstrong, 1999). The interventions meld public health and public safety concerns, and target members in multiple systems influential to a teen’s developmental outcomes, including the adolescent’s family and school, the judiciary, and treatment providers. Thus, they go beyond the fragmented, sometimes competitive treatment models too often seen in standard criminal justice and drug treatment settings (Belenko, 2000). Third, consistent with recommendations from the literature, NIDA has designated HIV/AIDS prevention in juvenile justice facilities as an urgent public health priority (NIDA, 2002). This\nstudy would test a family-based HIV/AIDS prevention intervention in comparison to standard HIV prevention. Finally, the systems-change possibilities and public policy implications of the proposed study are high, because the study would examine processes and outcomes of implementing the intervention in the real world settings in which the findings are meant to apply -- juvenile detention centers and outpatient community-based drug treatment agencies that work with young offenders (Armstrong and Altschuler, 1998).","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The fundamental objective of the proposed study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness and\nevaluate the relative and net benefit-cost of a cross-context multiple-systems family-based drug\nand HIV/STD focused intervention (MDFT-CS) with substance abusing juvenile offenders in\ndetention and as they transition into the community upon release.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The study randomized consenting subjects into two treatment groups.

In particular, the extent to which\n self-reported drug use is a valid indicator of actual drug use across\n social groups has been repeatedly questioned. While patterns across\n previous studies suggest that validity differences in self-reported\n drug use do exist, these differences could not be statistically\n evaluated because of the diversity in the types of high-risk\n populations studied, the types of drug use measured, and the\n measurement procedures and conditions of each study.

Certain hospital data elements were available throughout 2006. An additional year of 2011 follow-up data was also available for a subset of patients receiving medication treatment. The purpose of the data capture was to advance patient-centered outcomes research to reduce the morbidity and mortality of cancer and other comorbidities.\nA breast cancer pilot study was also conducted from a subset of all transmitted EMR records, consisting of admission records with a principal and/or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis between 174.0 and 174.9.  The subset dataset was then linked to the central cancer registry using patient social security number, first and last name, and date of birth.  Using a deterministic matching algorithm a total of 11,506 unique patients were matched to a patient in the FCDS database, resulting in 12,804 primary tumors and 53,940 unique hospital admission records.  While the hospital EMR defined the patient dataset, all registry records for that patient were included in the final breast cancer pilot database, regardless of the reporting hospital or the date of diagnosis.  This was to ensure capture of the entire diagnostic and treatment profile for each breast cancer patient.\nData Access\nThese data are not available from ICPSR.

Florida DOH and FCDS began receiving these hospital records and processing/linking them with other administrative databases between December 2011 and August, 2012.  Under the guidance of Florida DOH, the Florida Cancer Data System is the organizational producer of this pilot study dataset.\nThe study tables created for this project contain data for 11,506 unique breast cancer patients who were diagnosed and/or treated between 2007-2011 at a partnering Florida hospital.  Patient hospital EMRs were linked with Florida cancer registry data.  Other administrative databases were linked for updated hospital admissions/discharge records and mortality information from across the state.\nThe study database consists of hospital records for patient clinical characteristics, health histories, comorbid conditions for which specific treatment modalities are provided, including chemotherapy and radiation, medications orders, as well as the treatment doses administered on specific dates and times.  These hospital data also contain clinicians' notes during hospitalizations and at the time of discharge, pathology reports were generated for patient laboratory tests performed.  Financial charges for services provided to patients were collected from the hospital billing department.\nOther state administrative records merged for these study tables include routinely collected data from the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS), hospital discharge data and ambulatory records maintained by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), and mortality data collected by the Florida Department of Health, Office of Vital Statistics.\nPilot study data tables contain discrete and text data which include raw numeric values from hospital medical records, and include clinical notations retained in patient pathology reports and discharge summaries.

Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. </p>\n\n<p>Les données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles. Pour une liste complète et une description des variables de l'EPA, veuillez consulter le Guide de l'Enquête sur la population active, disponible sous la section Questionnaire(s) et guide(s) de déclaration ci-dessus.</p>\n\n<p>Ces données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.</p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nLeahy, A. 2014.

The ADR will allow HAB to characterize the individuals using the program, describe the ADAP-funded services being used, and delineate the costs associated with these services.\nADAPs will begin collecting data for the ADR in October 2012.

In 2001, the federal government provided funding to establish a permanent survey program on charitable giving, volunteering and participating within Statistics Canada. The survey itself was renamed the Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating (CSGVP). The CSGVP was developed through a partnership of federal government departments and voluntary sector organizations. These include Canadian Heritage, Health Canada, Human Resources and Social Development Canada, Imagine Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Statistics Canada and Volunteer Canada. There are two data files for the 2010 Canada Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating (CSGVP): the main answer file (MAIN.TXT), and the giving file (GS.TXT). For most questions in the CSGVP questionnaire, the reference period was the 12 months preceding the interview.

The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also administered in February 2003 (ICPSR 4526) and June 2003 (ICPSR 4527). These three supplements comprise the 2003 wave of TUS data.The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.The TUS, like most CPS supplements, was designed to be a proxy response supplement, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members, provided the respondent was a household member 15 years of age or older. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent supplement questions. All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS core items were eligible for the November 2003 supplement items.The TUS consisted of items PEA1 through PEK5. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for certain items. Information was collected from proxies on topics such as smoking status (items PEA1-PEA3) and the use of other tobacco-related products, such as pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PEJ1a-PEJ2a).In addition to these smoking status and other tobacco use questions, self-respondents were queried on the following topics depending on their smoking/tobacco use status (i.e., every day, some days, or former cigarette smokers and/or users of other non-cigarette tobacco products):\n\nSmoking history\nCurrent cigarette smoking prevalence and consumption\nType of cigarettes smoked\nPrice of last pack/carton of cigarettes purchased and state where purchased\nMedical and dental advice to quit smoking\nAttempts and intentions to quit smoking cigarettes and/or other forms of tobacco use\nWorkplace smoking policies and smoking rules in the home\nAttitudes toward smoking in public placesAnother generally unique feature to the 2003 TUS-CPS was the administration of questions to former smokers on their previous level of addiction, products/resources/methods used to quit smoking, and advice from health\nprofessionals. This feature enables comparisons between characteristics of former smokers (or successful quitters) and current smokers attempting to quit.Administrative information was collected on who the proxy\nrespondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected include age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States.

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS, referred to as the collection year, contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"United States Department of Justice.

The first group represented individuals who had lost loved\n ones to murder between 1994 and 1998 in one county in Texas (Parts\n 1-33). The second group (Parts 34-55) was comprised of county criminal\n justice professionals (murder detectives, prosecutors, criminal court\n judges, victim's service counselors, and victim's rights advocates).\n Names and contact information for the bereaved interviews were\n obtained from: (1) death certificate records furnished by the Texas\n Department of Health, (2) local newspaper articles, and (3)\n victim/witness counselors with the county District Attorney's\n Office. Individuals were asked to participate in the study via letters\n or telephone calls. The interviews allowed interviewees to talk about\n their experiences in their own words. Each interview lasted, on\n average, two-and-a-half hours. When the interview continued for more\n than two hours, the interviewer scheduled a second meeting. Those\n interviewees living out of state were interviewed via the telephone,\n while in-person interviews took place at the bereaved respondent's\n place of residence, local restaurants, or in the office of the\n interviewer. There was one non-English speaking bereaved, whose\n interview was conducted with the help of a Spanish-English interpreter\n who also transcribed the interview. For Parts 34-55, interviews were\n conducted with county criminal justice professionals. These interviews\n took approximately an hour to complete and took place in the\n professional's office, place of residence, or at local restaurants.\n All interviews (Parts 1-55) were tape-recorded and later transcribed\n by the interviewer, who replaced actual names of individuals,\n neighborhoods, cities, counties, or any other identifiable names with\npseudonyms.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Goodrum, Sarah Dugan.

The HIUS had been conducted on a biennial basis from 1997 to 2003 to measure household Internet use. As growth in the number of households using the Internet leveled off, the survey was redesigned to focus on how individuals, rather than households, are using the Internet. The individual-level CIUS was conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2009.<p/> \n\n<p>For 2010, the CIUS was redesigned to meet the measurement needs of the Broadband Canada: Connecting Rural Canadians Program, sponsored by Industry Canada. For the first time, the redesigned survey incorporated a hybrid design, consisting of both a Household Component and an Individual Component. <p/> \n\n<p>The 2012 CIUS was conducted under the 2010 design. <p/> \n\n<p>The Household Component includes a short series of questions on the type of Internet connections and devices used by household members, from home, as well as availability of high speed service, and a standard module on household income. The questions may be answered by any knowledgeable member of the household. <p/> \n\n<p>Following the Household Component, an individual aged 16 years and older was randomly selected to complete the Individual Component. Respondents were asked about their use of the Internet, and online activities including electronic commerce. While the Household Component covered Internet access at home, the Individual Component covers use of the Internet from any location. <p/> \n\n<p>The Individual Component begins with a module on Current User (CU) of the Internet. As in past years, the CIUS asks individuals about their locations of Internet use, frequency and intensity of use, and reasons for non-use. \nThe Specific Use (SU) module, as in 2010, asks respondents to report their Internet activities. These activities cover a wide range of topics including the use of email, instant messaging, formal education, and the search for employment. As with the 2010 survey, these activities could have taken place from any location and using any device. <p/> \n\n<p>The Electronic Commerce (EC) module collects information on the total number, the total cost, and the types of goods and services ordered over the internet. Additional information is also collected on the location of delivery, the means of payment, and the main reason for not participating in e-commerce. This module remained consistent with the 2010 survey. <p/> \n\n<p>The Privacy and Security (PS) module includes questions about online behaviour (e.g., use of security software, frequency of backing up files) and experiences related to security (e.g., experienced a computer virus). For the 2012 survey, this module was slightly modified with the addition of questions regarding concern for security while using internet banking or credit cards online. <p/> \n\n<p>As the 2010 and the 2012 surveys have two distinct components - household and individual - with revised and streamlined questions, it is not appropriate to make direct comparisons with results from previous years. Data users who have questions about the survey are invited to contact the Investment, Science and Technology Division (please refer to Chapter 1.0 for contact information). <p/>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nCanadian Intenet Use Survey 2012 [Canada]: Household File [public-use microdata file].

This study\nevolved out of an earlier LIFE (Living Insurance for Ex-Prisoners)\nstudy conducted in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1970s. In the LIFE\nstudy, 500 prisoners with a high probability of re-arrest were\nrandomly assigned at release from prison to experimental and control\ngroups which varied by the amount of money received (contingent upon\nemployment or unemployment and job placement services provided). The\nresults showed that ex-prisoners receiving payments were less likely\nto be re-arrested for property theft-related crimes than those who\nreceived only job placement or no services or payments of any\nkind. The United States Department of Labor commissioned the TARP\nexperiment, designed to replicate the LIFE experiment while providing\na larger and more representative sample of prisoners, greater\nvariation in treatment conditions, and administration of payments and job\nplacement services through existing agencies rather than by a special\npurpose project staff. Texas and Georgia were the states chosen for\nthe experiment, and stratified random samples of inmates were\nassigned, at the time of release from prison, to experimental and\ncontrol groups. The groups varied in the amount of money and job\nplacement services they received upon their release. Originally, the\ndata were recorded in nine files for each state corresponding to each\nof the nine different sources of information for each TARP case. The\nICPSR data collection combines these into one file for each state:\nPart 1 for Texas, and Part 2 for Georgia. Each file contains over\n1,500 variables, clustered in nine topic areas for each inmate: (1)\nprison history (e.g., background information, psychological and\naptitude test data, and prior criminal and present incarceration\nactivity), (2-5) data from four personal interviews (conducted at the\nprerelease, three-month, six-month, and 12-month stages and that\ninclude living arrangements, employment history, and financial\nstatus), (6) state arrest data, (7) records of TARP payments received,\n(8) social security wages, and (9) parole records.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Rossi, Peter, Richard A.

CCDF dollars are provided to states, territories, and tribes to provide assistance to low-income families receiving or in transition from temporary public assistance, to obtain quality child care so they can work, or depending on their state's policy, to attend training or receive education. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 requires states and territories to collect information on all family units receiving assistance through the CCDF and to submit monthly case-level data to the Office of Child Care. States are permitted to report case-level data for the entire population, or a sample of the population, under approved sampling guidelines. \nThe Summary Records file contains monthly state-level summary information including the number of families served. The Family Records file contains family-level data including single parent status of the head of household, monthly co-payment amount, date on which child care assistance began, reasons for care (e.g., employment, training/education, protective services, etc.), income used to determine eligibility, source of income, and the family size on which eligibility is based. The Child Records file contains child-level data including ethnicity, race, gender, and date of birth. The Setting Records file contains information about the type of child care setting, the total amount paid to the provider, and the total number of hours of care received by the child. The Pooling Factor file provides state-level data on the percentage of child care funds that is provided through the CCDF, the federal Head Start region the grantee (state) is in and is monitored by, and the state FIPS code for the grantee.

Also included as part of each annual collection is a zip archive of the Monitoring the Future public-use data and documentation for each respective year. The basic research design used by the Monitoring the Future study involves annual data collections from eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders throughout the coterminous United States during the spring of each year. The 8th/10th grade surveys used four different questionnaire forms (and only two forms from 1991-1996) rather than the six used with seniors. Identical forms are used for both eighth and tenth grades, and for the most part, questionnaire content is drawn from the twelfth-grade questionnaires. Thus, key demographic variables and measures of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs are generally identical for all three grades. However, many fewer questions about lifestyles and values are included in the 8th/10th grade forms. Drugs covered by this survey include tobacco, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, hashish, prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, inhalants, steroids, LSD, hallucinogens, amphetamines (stimulants), Ritalin (methylphenidate), Quaaludes (methaqualone), barbiturates (tranquilizers), cocaine, crack cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin, and GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate). Other topics include attitudes toward religion, changing roles for women, educational aspirations, self-esteem, exposure to drug education, and violence and crime (both in and out of school).","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Miech, Richard A., Lloyd D.

Parmi les principales séries de données économiques mensuelles, les estimations axées sur l'EPA sont les premières à être rendues publiques, les résultats de l'enquête étant diffusés 13 jours seulement après la fin de la collecte des données.\n\nL'Enquête canadienne sur la population active a été conçue à la suite de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale pour répondre à un besoin en données fiables et à jour sur le marché du travail. Était alors requise, de façon urgente, de l'information concernant les changements radicaux qu'avait entraînés pour le marché du travail la transition d'une économie de guerre à une économie de paix. L'EPA a pour objectif de répartir la population en âge de travailler en trois catégories qui s'excluent mutuellement, à savoir celles des personnes occupées, des chômeurs et des inactifs, ainsi que de fournir des données descriptives et explicatives sur chacune de ces catégories. \n\nLes données de l'EPA sont utilisées pour produire le très connu taux de chômage ainsi que d'autre indicateurs de base du marché de travail tel que le taux d'emploi et le taux d'activité. En plus, l'EPA procure également des estimations de l'emploi selon la branche d'activité, la profession, le nombre d'heures travaillées et davantage. Il est possible de croiser ces séries selon une variété de caractéristiques démographiques. Des estimations sont diffusées pour le Canada, les provinces, les territoires et pour plusieurs régions infraprovincial. Pour les employés, des séries sur les salaires, la couverture syndicale, la permanence de l'emploi et la taille du lieu de travail sont également disponibles.\n\nCes données sont utilisées par les différents paliers de gouvernements pour évaluer et planifier les programmes d'emploi au Canada. Les taux de chômage régionaux sont utilisés par Développement des ressources humaines Canada pour déterminer l'admissibilité au régime d'Assurance-emploi, de même que le niveau et la durée des prestations pour les personnes qui vivent à l'intérieur d'une région d'assurance-emploi donnée. Ainsi, les données sont utilisées par les économistes du marché du travail, les analystes, les consultants, les planificateurs, les prévisionnistes ainsi que les universitaires et ce, autant du secteur public que privé.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nMowers, S. 2009.

Today, the ITS provides a full range of statistics on the volume of international travellers and detailed characteristics of their trips such as expenditures, activities, places visited and length of stay. The ITS covers both Canadian residents returning from trips outside Canada and international visitors to Canada. In addition to fulfilling BOP requirements, the ITS is also being used by the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), Customs Canada, the Canadian tourism Commission (CTC), provincial tourism agencies, the United States Department of Commerce and a number of private sector industries. The ITS is also used for reporting to international organizations such as the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Pacific-Asia Tourism Association.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada.

The information will allow managers and employees to initiate concrete actions in their own department, and where warranted, across the Public Service. \n\nThe effects of Program Review, government restructuring, increased workload and rapid technological advances have greatly affected federal Public Service employees. Recent studies and reports on specific segments of the federal Public Service had shown that low morale was prevalent among executives and knowledge workers and that many employees felt that workplace conditions were not conducive to confidence in management, job satisfaction and career advancement. Much additional information was required in order to further evaluate these findings and determine how the present workplace structure could be improved to meet the challenges facing it at the turn of the new millennium.\n\nIn 1997, the Clerk of the Privy Council introduced the idea of a voluntary survey of all federal Public Service employees. The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) was asked to implement the project. The TBS worked in consultation with other key federal departments to develop a national survey that would gather information from all employees through a common questionnaire. As part of the project, Statistics Canada was asked to participate in the development and to collect and process the data. \n\nThe survey results will be used to develop actions at the level of the department, sector or branch and ultimately at the work unit level. The results would also serve as input to the future corporate management agenda. The survey will provide a baseline against which future progress in renewing the workplace can be measured.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Statistics Canada.

This particular survey was concerned with the attitudes and opinions of the citizens of Zimbabwe. Respondents in a face-to-face interview were asked to rate Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and his administration's overall performance, to state the most important issues facing the nation, and to evaluate the effectiveness of certain continental and international institutions. Opinions were gathered on the role of the government in improving the economy, whether corruption existed in local and national government, whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, and whether local government officials, the police, the courts, the overall criminal justice system, the media, the National Electoral Commission, and the government broadcasting service could be trusted. Respondents were polled on their knowledge of government officials, their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, their participation in national elections, the inclusiveness of the government, and the identification of causes of conflict and resources that may aid in the resolution of conflict. Economic questions addressed the past, present, and future of the country's and the respondent's economic condition, and whether great income disparities are fair. Societal questions were asked of respondents concerning the meaning of being \"poor\" and \"rich,\" monetary support systems, personal responsibility for success or failure, characteristics used in self-identification, methods for securing food, water, schooling, medical services, news and information, and ease of obtaining assistance for certain services. Background variables include age, gender, ethnicity, education, religious affiliation and participation, political party affiliation, language spoken most at home, whether respondent was head of household, current and past employment status, whether a close friend or relative had died from AIDS, language used in interview, and type of physical disability, if any. In addition, demographic information pertaining to the interviewer is provided, as well as their response to the interview and observations of the respondent's attitude during the interview and of the interview environment.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Masunungure, Eldred, Michael Bratton, E.

The data about States and Territories' licensing policies, including facility monitoring, enforcement of licensing regulations, and licensing program staffing, were gathered by the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA) in the 2014 NARA Child Care Licensing Programs and Policies Survey. NARA sent an online survey to all state child care licensing agencies in September 2014.

The principal investigators based their\ndefinition of income on cash payments and on a broad range of\nadditional components: payments in kind valued at market prices,\nagricultural output produced for self-consumption valued at market\nprices, the value of food and other direct subsidies, and the imputed\nvalue of housing services. The rural component of this collection\nconsists of two data files, one in which the individual is the unit of\nanalysis (Part 1) and a second in which the household is the unit of\nanalysis (Part 2). Individual rural respondents reported on their employment\nstatus, level of education, Communist Party membership, type of\nemployer (e.g., public, private, or foreign), type of economic sector\nin which they were employed, occupation, whether they held a second job,\nretirement status, monthly pension, monthly wage, and other sources of\nincome. Demographic variables include relationship to householder,\ngender, age, and student status. Rural households reported extensively\non the character of the household and residence. Information was\nelicited on type of terrain surrounding the house, geographic\nposition, type of house, and availability of electricity. Also\nreported were sources of household income (e.g., farming, industry,\ngovernment, rents, and interest), taxes paid, value of farm, total\namount and type of cultivated land, financial assets and debts,\nquantity and value of various crops, amount of grain purchased or\nprovided by a collective, use of chemical fertilizers, gasoline, and\noil, quantity and value of agricultural machinery, and all household\nexpenditures (e.g., food, fuel, medicine, education, transportation,\nand electricity). The urban component of this collection also consists\nof two data files, one in which the individual is the unit of analysis (Part 3)\nand a second in which the household is the unit of analysis (Part 4).\nIndividual urban respondents reported on their economic status within\nthe household, Communist Party membership, sex, age, nature of\nemployment, and relationship to the household head. Information was\ncollected on all types and sources of income from each member of the\nhousehold whether working, nonworking, or retired, all revenue\nreceived by owners of private or individual enterprises, and all\nin-kind payments (e.g., food, durable goods, and nondurable goods). Urban\nhouseholds reported total income (including salaries, interest on\nsavings and bonds, dividends, rent, leases, alimony, gifts, and\nboarding fees), all types and values of food subsidies received, and\ntotal debt. Information was also gathered on household accommodations\nand living conditions, including number of rooms, total living area in\nsquare meters, availability and cost of running water, sanitary\nfacilities, heating and air-conditioning equipment, kitchen\navailability, location of residence, ownership of home, and\navailability of electricity and telephone. Households reported on all\ntheir expenditures including amounts spent on food items such as\nwheat, rice, edible oils, pork, beef and mutton, poultry, fish and\nseafood, sugar, and vegetables by means of coupons in state-owned\nstores and at free market prices. Information was also collected on\nrents paid by the households, fuel available, type of transportation\nused, and availability and use of medical and child care.\nThe Chinese Household Income Project collected data in 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007.

It was designed to advance the understanding of the\n developmental pathways of both positive and negative human social\n behaviors. In particular, the project examined the causes and pathways\n of juvenile delinquency, adult crime, substance abuse, and\n violence. At the same time, the project provided a detailed look at\n the environments in which these social behaviors took place by\n collecting substantial amounts of data about urban Chicago, including\n its people, institutions, and resources. Longitudinal\n Cohort Study One component of the PHDCN was the\n Longitudinal Cohort Study, which was a series of coordinated\n longitudinal studies that followed over 6,000 randomly selected\n children, adolescents, and young adults, and their primary caregivers\n over time to examine the changing circumstances of their lives, as\n well as the personal characteristics, that might lead them toward or\n away from a variety of antisocial behaviors. The age cohorts include\n birth (0), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years.

Self Report of\n Offending The data in this collection are from Wave 2 of\n the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which was administered between 1997 and\n 2000.

The project collapsed 847 census tracts in\n the city of Chicago into 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon\n seven groupings of racial/ethnic composition and three levels of\n socioeconomic status. The NCs were designed to be ecologically\n meaningful. They were composed of geographically contiguous census\n tracts and geographic boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's\n neighborhoods were considered in the definition of the NCs. Each NC\n was comprised of approximately 8,000 people. Longitudinal\n Cohort Study For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a\n stratified probability sample of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80\n NCs were sampled from the 21 strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by\n three socioeconomic levels) with the goal of representing the 21 cells\n as equally as possible to eliminate the confounding between\n racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic status. Once the 80 NCs were\n chosen, then block groups were selected at random within each of the\n sample neighborhoods. A complete listing of dwelling units was\n collected for all sampled block groups. Pregnant women, children, and\n young adults in seven age cohorts (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18\n years) were identified through in-person screening of approximately\n 40,000 dwelling units within the 80 NCs. The screening response rate\n was 80 percent. Children within six months of the birthday that\n qualified them for the sample were selected for inclusion in the\n Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of 8,347 participants were\n identified through the screening. Of the eligible study participants,\n 6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data collection, and 5,338 were\n interviewed in the Wave 2 data collection. Data collection for\n Wave 2 began in 1997 and ended in 2000. It included a letter sent to\n study participants notifying them that they would be contacted to\n schedule an interview. This letter explained the study,\n reimbursements, and offered a monthly drawing prize of $1,000 for\n those participants who kept their first scheduled appointment. A toll\n free number was also included in the letter, so participants could\n call and schedule their own interviews or ask questions. For\n all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the child\n were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to spend\n the most time taking care of the child. Separate research assistants\n administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child\n interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face\n interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the\n personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated\n telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in\n Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 2 who lived\n outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants\n were able to travel for interviews. A total of 221 telephone\n interviews were conducted during Wave 2, representing 3.55 percent of\n the sample. Proxy interviews were conducted with study\n participants who were emancipated minors (under 18 but married or\n living independently). The study participants answered questions from\n the primary caregiver's interview on the primary caregiver's\n behalf. In Wave 2, four primary caregivers and two study participants\n were interviewed in jail. Study participants in foster care could not\n be interviewed. The Department of Children and Family Services did not\n allow interviews of the foster parent or the child. Permission was\n granted for a brief period in Wave 1, therefore there are some\n children in the sample who could not be followed up in Waves 2 and\n 3. Some children were not in foster care in Wave 1 but were placed in\n foster care by Wave 2 or 3. They were also not followed up. Lastly,\n some participants were interviewed in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as\n they were in foster care during Wave 2. Some participants in\n Wave 1 spoke a language other than English, Spanish, or Polish. In\n Wave 2, an abbreviated version of the primary caregiver's protocol was\n administered, and the research assistant arranged for someone in the\n household to translate on the spot. In Wave 2, the complete protocol\n was translated into Spanish, and a subset of the primary caregiver's\n interview was translated into Polish. Depending on the age and\n wave of data collection, participants were paid between $5 and $20 per\n interview. Other incentives, such as free passes to museums, the\n aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes were also included.\n Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For\n example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking\n traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,\n delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and\n self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also\n interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,\n parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental\n health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.\n Self Report of Offending  The Self Report of\n Offending was adapted from the Self-Report of Delinquency\n Questionnaire and the Self-Report of Antisocial Behavior Questionnaire\n to cover ages seven to adulthood. Information about lifetime and past\n year involvement in 35 delinquent and criminal behaviors (including\n theft, assault, and public disorder) was obtained with follow-up\n prompts designed to obtain information about age of onset and date of\n recent involvement as well as other factors such as police involvement\n or solitary versus group offending. Information regarding the\n participant's involvement with the police and court system was also\nobtained.","metadata-type":"element"},{"abstract":"The data files contain information regarding the\n participant's involvement in various delinquent acts or crimes, such\n as truancy, weapon use, public disorder, arson, theft, fraud, illegal\n drug use, assault, illegal sexual activities, and traffic violations.\n In addition, data were collected regarding the consequences of the\n participant's activities, including information regarding treatment\nprograms, court appearances, and legal outcomes.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Earls, Felton J., Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, Stephen W.

The data generated from the responses to the supplement will provide input to determine the rates for quota reductions for qualified employers. Although the Absence from Work Survey collects information on absences from work due to illness, accident or pregnancy, it does not provide a complete picture of people who have been absent from work for these reasons because the concepts and definitions have been developed specifically for the needs of the client. Absences in this survey are defined as being at least two weeks in length, and respondents are only asked the three reasons for their most recent absence and the one preceding it.\n<br>\nThe Absence From Work Survey, 1981, was conducted in 1980, that is, the Reference Year is 1980.\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"University of Guelph.

The survey focuses on the health of Canadians aged 45 and over by examining the various factors that impact healthy aging, such as general health and well-being, physical activity, use of health care services, social participation, as well as work and retirement transitions.\n\nPolicy makers, researchers and planners are aware that planning for the future of an aging population is an important activity now and in the coming years. This survey will help them make informed decisions regarding health care, social services and income support programs that will affect all Canadians. \n\nThe specific objectives of the survey are: \n\n1. To better understand the aging process of people aged 45 and over by collecting data on various aspects of their health and well being, use of health care services, social support and participation and work and retirement transitions. \n\n2. To examine how lifestyle determinants affect health as people age.\n\n3. To examine the links among healthy aging and social, demographic, geographic and economic variables or characteristics using a multidisciplinary approach.\n\n4.

Since its inception in 1945, the objectives of the LFS have been to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications -employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these categories. Data from the survey provide information on major labour market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors\r\n, hours worked, labour force participation and unemployment rates, employment including the self-employed, full and part-time employment, and unemployment. It publishes monthly standard labour market indicators such as the unemployment rate, the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS is a major source of information on the personal characteristics of the working-age population, including age, sex, marital status, educational attainment, and family characteristics. Employment estimates include detailed breakdowns by demographic characteristics, industry and occupation,job tenure, and usual and actual hours worked. This dataset is designed to provide the user with historical information from the Labour Force Survey. The tables included are monthly and annual, with some dating back to 1976. Most tables are available by province as well as nationally. Demographic, industry, occupation and other indicators are presented in tables derived from the LFS data. The information generated by the survey has expanded considerably over the years with a major redesign of the survey content in 1976 and again in 1997, and provides a rich and detailed picture of the Canadian labour market.\r\n</p> <p>Some changes to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) were introduced which affect data back to 1987. There are three reasons for this revision:</p> <ol> <li>The revision enables the use of improved population benchmarks in the LFS estimation process. These improved benchmarks provide better information on the number of non-permanent residents.</li> <li>There are changes to the data for the public and private sectors from 1987 to 1999. In the past, the data on the public and private sectors for\r\nthis period were based on an old definition of the public sector. The revised data better reflects the current public sector definition, and therefore result in a longer time series for analysis.\r\n</li> <li>The geographic coding of several small Census Agglomerations (CA) has been updated historically from 1996 urban centre boundaries to 2001 CA boundaries. This affects data from January 1987 to December 2004. It is important to note that the changes to almost all estimates are very minor, with the exception of the public sector series and some associated industries from 1987 to 1999. Rates of unemployment, employment and participation are essentially unchanged, as are all key labour mark\r\net trends. The article titled Improvements in 2006 to the LFS (also under the LFS Documentation button) provides an overview of the effect of these changes on the estimates.\r\n</li> </ol> <p>The seasonally-adjusted tables have been revised back three years (beginning with January 2004) based on the latest seasonal output.</p>","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Statistics Canada, 2016,

The data file contains variables from the original USMS files as well as additional analysis variables, or \"SAF\" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 1.1-1.3. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

Identification of protein interactions is a major goal in molecular biology, but biochemical methods, although improving, remain limited in coverage and accuracy. Whereas computational predictions can guide biochemical experiments, low validation rates of  predictions remain a major limitation. Here, we investigated computational methods in the prediction of a specific type of interaction, the inhibitory interactions between proteases and their inhibitors. Proteases generate thousands of proteoforms that dynamically shape the functional state of proteomes. Despite the important regulatory role of proteases, knowledge of their inhibitors remains largely incomplete with the vast majority of proteases lacking an annotated inhibitor. To link inhibitors to their target proteases on a large scale, we applied computational methods to predict inhibitory interactions between proteases and their inhibitors based on complementary data including coexpression, phylogenetic similarity, structural information, co-annotation, and colocalization, and also surveyed general protein interaction networks for potential inhibitory interactions. In testing nine predicted interactions biochemically, we validated the inhibition of kallikrein 5 by serpin B12. Despite the use of a wide array of complementary data, we found a high false positive rate of computational predictions in biochemical follow-up. Based on a protease-specific definition of true negatives derived from the biochemical classification of proteases and inhibitors, we analyzed prediction accuracy of individual features. Thereby we identified feature-specific limitations, which also affected general protein interaction prediction methods. Interestingly, proteases were often not coexpressed with most of their functional inhibitors, contrary to what is commonly assumed and extrapolated predominantly from cell culture experiments. Predictions of inhibitory interactions were indeed more challenging than predictions of non-proteolytic and non-inhibitory interactions. In summary, we describe a novel and well-defined but difficult protein interaction prediction task, and thereby highlight limitations of computational interaction prediction methods.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Fortelny, Nikolaus; Butler, Georgina; Overall, Christopher; Pavlidis, Paul, 2017, \"Protease-inhibitor interaction predictions: Lessons on the complexity of protein-protein interactions\", http://hdl.handle.net/11272/10472 University of British Columbia  [Distributor] V7 [Version]","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"Fortelny N, Butler GS, Overall CM, Pavlidis P. \"Protease-Inhibitor Interaction Predictions: Lessons on the Complexity of Protein–Protein Interactions.\" Molecular & Cellular Proteomics : MCP. 2017;16(6):1038-1051. doi:10.1074/mcp.M116.065706.","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"MSL, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Centre for Blood Research, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"Centre for Blood Research, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty_affiliation":"MSL, UBC","metadata-type":"attribute"},{"AuthEnty":"Fortelny, Nikolaus","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Butler, Georgina","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Overall, Christopher","metadata-type":"element"},{"AuthEnty":"Pavlidis, Paul","metadata-type":"element"},{"prodPlac":"Vancouver, BC","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"proteases","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"proteinprotein interaction","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"proteaseinhibitor interaction","metadata-type":"element"},{"keyword":"computational prediction","metadata-type":"element"},{"producer":"Michael Smith Laboratories\n","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"producer":"University of British Columbia \n","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"prodDate":"2017","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"date":"2018","metadata-type":"constraint"},{"TI-facet":"Protease-inhibitor interaction predictions: Lessons on the complexity of protein-protein interactions","metadata-type":"constraint"}]},{"index":239,"uri":"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml","path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook","score":0,"confidence":0,"fitness":0,"href":"/v1/documents?uri=%2Fodesi%2Flfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml","mimetype":"application/xml","format":"xml","matches":[{"path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/titl","match-text":["\n",{"highlight":"Labour"}," ",{"highlight":"Force"}," ",{"highlight":"Survey"},", ",{"highlight":"March"}," ",{"highlight":"1997"}," [",{"highlight":"Canada"},"] [",{"highlight":"Rebased"},"]\n"]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/subTitl","match-text":["\n",{"highlight":"Labour"}," ",{"highlight":"Force"}," ",{"highlight":"Survey"},", ",{"highlight":"March"}," ",{"highlight":"1997"}," [",{"highlight":"Rebased"},"]\n"]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/altTitl","match-text":["\n",{"highlight":"LFS"},", ",{"highlight":"March"}," ",{"highlight":"1997"}," [",{"highlight":"Rebased"},"]\n"]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/IDNo","match-text":["\n",{"highlight":"lfs"},"-",{"highlight":"71M0001XCB"},"-",{"highlight":"E"},"-",{"highlight":"1997"},"-",{"highlight":"march"},"-",{"highlight":"rebased"},"\n"]},{"path":"fn:doc(\"/odesi/lfs-71M0001XCB-E-1997-march-rebased.xml\")/codeBook/docDscr/citation/titlStmt/*:syear","match-text":[{"highlight":"1997"}]}],"metadata":[{"abstract":"\n<p>The Labour Force Survey provides estimates of employment and unemployment which are among the most timely and important measures of performance of the Canadian economy.

With the release of the survey results only 13 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. </p>\n\n<p>The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. </p>\n\n<p>LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. </p>\n\n<p>These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Human Resources Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector. </p>\n\n<p>Note: Because missing values are removed from this dataset, any form of non-response (e.g. valid skip, not stated) or don't know/refusal cannot be coded as a missing. The \"Sysmiss\" label in the Statistics section indicates the number of non-responding records for each variable, and the \"Valid\" values in the Statistics section indicate the number of responding records for each variable. The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. </p>\n\n<p>LFS revisions: \nLFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. </p>\n","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"\nStatistics Canada. 1996.

Those who were registered to vote were asked about how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign, their opinions of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates, whether they had voted in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus that year, the likelihood that they would vote in the general election and for whom, and whether they planned to vote in person on election day, by mail or absentee ballot, or at an early voting location.

After the election, 1,220 adults were re-interviewed in a call-back poll conducted November 7-10, 2008. Respondents who had voted were asked who they had voted for, when they had finally decided on a candidate, the main reason they chose that candidate, which voting method they used, how long they had waited in line to vote, and whether they were contacted by a presidential campaign. Those who did not vote were asked about the main reason they did not vote. All respondents in the call-back poll were asked whether progress had been made against racial discrimination since the 1960s, whether they were pleased with the outcome of the election, and their views on the upcoming Obama presidency. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, marital status, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, length of time at current residence, military service, religious preference, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian.","metadata-type":"element"},{"biblCit":"CBS News.
